I am concerned that my blood pressure was 148 over 78 and that my resting heart rate after several tests was 117 am I right to be concerned over these results?\\nAnswer: Hello, I would explain that a single high blood pressure value and high heart rate value could be related to anxiety and does not indicate any serious medical disorder. For this reason, I would recommend you to closely monitor your heart rate and blood pressure values in the next days. If high blood pressure values persist, I would recommend performing some other tests: - a resting ECG - complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation - thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction - blood electrolytes - fasting glucose - kidney and liver function tests. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Ilir Sharka, Cardiologist',\n",

I began having dental problems around the time I was diagnosed in 98- I ve spent thousands of hours and dollars on dental work, but in last 2 yrs I ve lost most of my teeth, the few left are in bad shape. I can t afford much as i only have SSI. Is the ITP affecting my teeth or is the dental decay exasperating my ITP? AND HOW CAN I GET DENTURES AFFORDABLY???\\nAnswer: Thanks for your query, i have gone through your query, the ITP can cause gum problems like periodontitis which makes the teeth week and mobile. the drugs you are taking like steroids can result in opurtunistic infections like candidiasis. ITP can cause severe bleeding from gums. after consulting your oral physician get a radiograph done like OPG and check the level of supporting bone in the remaining teeth. if its fine then you can get denture done preserving those teeth. otherwise you have to get all the teeth removed and get complete denture done. its better to get teeth removed and go for complete denture. i hope my answer will help you. take care.',\n",

I have also changed my diet since that time and have gone from more fatty, sugar enriched foods to healthier foods i.e. fruits vegetables as opposed to a burger. I have began noticing a change in my behavior since about the beginning of March, 2011. My body has been more anxious or fidgety and I have trouble sitting still and wanting to move, mostly all symptoms associated with add/adhd. I was wondering if the creatine use could be causing these urges to move. I just started taking beta alanine a day ago as well but these symptoms have been going on for about a month before the beta alanine. Thank you for help.\\nAnswer: Hello Creatine is a protein supplement used to increase power and performance of muscles. It is considered as safe supplement in most of individuals. But it increases load on kidney. It is known to cause stomach upset, epigastric burning and anxiety in a lot of individuals. Persons may experience symptoms like insomnia, palpitations with creatine. Fidgeting and anxiety is most likely due to creatine supplementation. I would recommend you to consult a Psychiatrist if problem persist.Hope this helps you, thanks',\n",

I think that the pain is related to sleeping in a funny position last night, but just want to be sure it s not heart related. The pain worsens with movement, and I can feel it quite acutely when I swallow food, and also when I burp. \\\\\\nAnswer: Hello,As per your history and description, the possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely because your pain is associated with movements.So follow the below steps for better symptomatic relief in musculoskeletal pain:1. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise.2. Avoid movements causing pain.3. Avoid sudden jerky movements of chest and back.4. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest.5. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs like Ibuprofen and Thiocolchicoside.You will mostly improve with all these in 2 to 3 days. If not improving then consult the doctor for ECG and 2d echo tests to rule out heart diseases.Hope I have answered your query.

              "  'Question: Hi doctor, I had sex for the first time.\\xa0After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?\\nAnswer: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

It is now one week later and today the same feeling has happened twice. It s a very uncomfortable pressure in my head.

Am wondering if this could be serious enough to go to hospital or what it is or what may be causing it? Any advice would be very helpful thank you!\\nAnswer: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. MDMA is a subtype of amphetamine and drug speed as well is amphetamine, both of which interfere with epinephrine and serotonine reuptake, causing the symptoms you had due to a probably high blood pressure or due to dehydration becuase these cause an increase of diuresis.By now you should have eliminated these substances from your blood, so your headache should not be a conseguence.

Implantation bleeding occurs at the time of the period and just like spotting, it is brown to pink colour. If your period is delayed by more than 8 to 10 days, then go for urine pregnancy test and or blood HCG test to confirm the pregnancy.

I seem to fell better and then late afternoon feel bad.\\nAnswer: Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Being hot and chilled and then get to sweat, lead us to think about Infection. It is hard to detect the cause especially without a history of medications or any other symptoms. But I'm sure to say it looks to be far away from being a cardiac cause. Possible conditions are hidden fever for some infection in your body or thyroid disorder. You may need to visit your doctor and most probably he/she will do some lab for you like ESR, CBC to check for any infection and thyroid function tests to check its state.

              "  'Question: Hello doctor, I have had a gallbladder operation last year and an umbilical hernia, then I ended up with diverticulitis a couple of months ago. That pain has never gone away. So I went and got an upper and lower GI done and it was clear. The pain is centered in the upper part of my belly and feels like a rock it is constant pain and it gets worse when I eat. The other pain comes from both sides about three to four inches above my pelvic bone to the right and left. Then I get a stabbing feeling in both places as well as in between the nurses wanted me to consult a gynecologist. I am just trying to make the pain stop. A year after my operation I gained about 100 lbs, but it is my stomach that is swollen all the time. It looks like I am nine months pregnant. Please help.\\nAnswer: Hi. Symptoms you have mentioned are indicating towards gastritis or acid peptic disease. Still, I need more information. Why you underwent GB (gallbladder) surgery? You did not mention the GI series report, it was before the onset of pain or after the onset of pain? Is there a regurgitation of food or vomiting? If yes are there blood in vomit? These kinds of problem is associated with an excess weight. And it is associated with other problems also e.g. NASH (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), metabolic syndrome. Advice. 1. Start on Rabeprazole and Domperidone combination tablet twice a day half an hour before a meal. This will help to alleviate your pain by suppressing acid activity. 2. Take Pepcid (Famotidine) syrup 5 ml along with meals in the initial 10 days of treatment, it will relieve severe pain. 3. Avoid fatty foods. 4. Make a diet chart whatever you are eating in the next seven days, we will modify it. 5. Do exercise to loose weight. Obesity is a known risk factor of these problems and others that I have already mentioned. 6 Get done investigations, CBC (complete blood count), liver function test, lipid profile, fasting and post prandial blood glucose level, and thyroid function tests (T3, T4, TSH). Review with above-mentioned details and reports.',\n",

              "  'Question: Hi doctor, Does Ayurvedic massage help to remove toxins from the tissues? Do they help to remove toxins from the body through the skin? Which organs are used to eliminate the toxins from the body?\\nAnswer: Hi. Ayurvedic massage loosens the toxins from the body, and by a steam bath, it will get eliminated from the body in the form of sweat. The therapy used to remove toxins from the body is called panchakarma which includes five procedures. First one is called Vamana karma which is also known as medical emesis. Virechan is one of the panchakarma therapy where the toxins are eliminated in the form of loose motion. Basti is the other form of panchakarma therapy where different types of enema are used. Nasya is a kind of panchakarma treatment where the oil is poured in the nostrils. Raktamokshan is a procedure of bloodletting. These therapies will help to remove toxins from the body through mouth, anus, skin, and nostrils in the form of motion, vomiting, sweating, cough, and bleeding.',\n",

There also younger by 5 years. I'm 19. I. Really feel like my childhood took a toll\\nAnswer: DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Please understand masturbation is normal, natural and never unhealthy. Masturbation cannot lead to impotency or any other sexual problems. Your masturbation habit cannot adversely affect your child bearing ability. Also your masturbation habit cannot reduce the size of your penis or shrinkage of your testicles. Therefore don't worry about that aspect. But I suggest you to reduce the masturbation frequency to three or four times a week because masturbation is energy consuming. If you masturbate at the present rate, your energy will be very low, you will not be able to do other day to day duties like studying, exercise etc. As a result you will be anxious, as you are feeling now. If you reduce your masturbation to three or four times a wee, it will never effect your sexual life. It cannot cause any dermatological problems. It cannot cause any health issues except anxiety. No other side effects.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.  Make sure that you include every minute details possible. Hope this answers your query.

              "  'Question: what is the incubation period for Zika virus and what are presenting symptoms? I recently returned from Central America and there were mosquitos in the area. I had been home 1 week before breaking out in a rash which started in hands and feet and has progressed over 48 hours to now cover most of my body. What are the symptoms and incubation period for Zika virus?\\nAnswer: Hi.I have gone through your question and understand your concern. Zika virus is a new emerging mosquito borne disease. Its incubation period is not clear,likely to be few days.As it is spreaded by bite of Aedes mosquito which is popularly known to spread dengue fever.Symptoms of Zika virus are similar to dengue, which include fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise, and headache. These symptoms are usually mild and last for 2-7 days.I would suggest you to get Complete Blood Count,complete bed rest and raise intake of fluids.If it gets worse and find any bleeding manifestations then consult your doctor.Regards',\n",

There are various effective therapies for depression like fluoxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine or escitalopram and they are all very effective and mostly safe. You may also require some benzodiazepines like clonazepam or lorazepam for a short period like 2-3 weeks to reduce the anxiety and help with your sleep.  Also you can try cognitive retraining exercises. These help in improving attention and memory as well.

First and foremost avoid taking alcohol or alcohol containing beverages, as its use is related to liver injury2. Avoid fatty meals (both vegan and non vegan), fast and junk foods, salted snacks, dry fruits, red meat, egg yolk, sweetened carbonated drinks and smoking.3. Eat a balanced healthy diet (vegetables, cereals, fruits, baked fish and poultry). A homed cooked food is highly recommended.4.

Doc) no kidney stones, not pregnant, nor tubal pregnancy, no gall bladder probs. The quickest appt. available with my o.b. is Monday.\\nAnswer: Looks like your pain is more over related to lower back spine,  disc as well the nerves coming out and going to legs from that level.  It can also be a simple nerve trade under the gluteus muscle and we called it as sciatica.  I suggest to use hot and cold pack at your painful part back and buttocks frequently in a day time and check for result.  It should give you some relief.

Human spine  contains vertebra  and between two vertebra is intervertebral  disc which is named  according to the  location of vertebra.  So l45 disc is located between l4 and L5  vertebra and L5s1  is  between L5 and s1.  These two discs are located in bottom of spine. Now prolapse means this discs has come out of its space and compressing  structures in spinal canal which includes nerves and the car.  So your mri report is suggestive  of  disc prolapse at l45 and l5s1 levels with compression  of  thecal matter and nerve roots.  For assessing severity  of  prolapse  canal diameters are  required which is lacking in your report. So considering your report you require conservative  management.  Avoid forward bending and weight lifting.  Sleep on hard bed. Take tab diclofenac plus thiocolchicoside combination twice a day and tab ultracet one at bedtime. Start physiotherapy with  1. Back strengthening exercises 2 back extension excersise and 3. Abdominal strengthening excersise.  Do this on regular basis and you will get long term relief.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?\\nAnswer: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Is it common or anything to worry??I am 28 years old, unmarried man and I never had sex. thanks Jithu\\nAnswer: DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. The white discharge you are talking about here is semen itself. semen discharge through penis during bowel movement is quite common and there is nothing to worry about it. your body produces semen whenever you are sexually aroused. Such produced semen will be stored inside your body and it is a waste product. Body will try to clear it out of the body. If you do not masturbate or engage in sex, and eject the semen, body has to find alternative methods. Body uses nocturnal ejaculation method or ''viction through urine'' method. These are natural process and you do not have any control over it and therefore do not worry or be anxious about it.If you still need my assistance in this regard, please use this link.

He is doing a healthy life with the walks.He needs to do another blood test after 1 month or more to check the ALT/AST levels. But as i said ,a level of 47 is normal,so don't worry at all.If you have any other question,feel free to ask me.Dr.Endri Katro\",\n",
              "  'Question: Hello Doctor. Thank you very much in advance for your help. It is greatly appreciated. After being on 400 MG of Tramadol for nearly 4 years due to nerve damage as a result of my post inguinal hernia surgery back in 2011, I have been off of Tramadol for 2 months now. I made the decision to stop due to the fact it was not helping the pain anymore. I have gotten through most of the physical withdrawals (hell on earth), although I still suffer from slight nausea and acid reflux/GERD like symptoms. The worst part is the mental depression and anxiety I am still dealing with today due to my weaning off this med. I have been prescribed anti-depressant to counter this, but it just seems my brain was so altered by the tramadols chemical properties, I have yet to experience any relief from this. My question is, When/will I get better? What can I do now in your opinion (besides exercise, meditation) to help this recovery process? Thank you Doctor for your time. Matthew\\nAnswer: DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. You should know that these problems are not mental diseases, but are mental disorders. Many researches and researchers confirm that medicines alone cannot cure mental disorders. Exercise, Life style changes, change in thinking pattern, relaxation etc are as essential as medicines. Psychotherapy can help you changing your lifestyle and thinking patterns. Yoga and meditation help you to streamline your metabolism and neurological balance. Please consult a psychologist for further information.Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement.

It seems like it might be growing a bit . Should I be concerned?\\nAnswer: Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The lump on the side of your temple which is more prominent on clenching the jaws is likely to be due to a superficial swelling like a lipoma or a sebaceous cyst.

The needle was placed in my rt hand due to my tiny rolling veins.Today I noticed that the vein has turned black and there is swollen area at the base of my wrist. I have pain going up my arm into my right shoulder and numbness in my right hand. What is causing\\nAnswer: Hello,Bruising and bleeding from a punctured vessel is not uncommon when difficulty arises placing a needle. I do feel uncomfortable that you report pain and numbness after 2 weeks. Were you placed on an antibiotic?  Please return to your treating doctor or physician to evaluate your condition. If an infection has occured and is spreading you will require an antibiotic and medication to control the inflammation.A large hematoma may take time to resolve. Pressure, swelling and inflammation may occur. Was pressure applied after the needle was removed? Were there any complications with removing the needle? Do you have any bleeding disorder or difficulty clotting? Any other medical conditions?I suggest taking anti-inflammatory medication. Common medications such as tylenol, advil and the anti-histamine Benadryl can decrease inflammation and swelling. If your condition worsens seek attention immediately. This may be unrelated due to the time span and may indicate a separate condition or allergic reaction.Thank you for your inquiry.

Now there is still drainage and the skin around the belly button is discolored (a grey to purple color). I also noticed a purple discoloration to the top of his penis. It appears that the top of his penis touched his belly button and got silver nitrate on it. Should I be concerned?\\nAnswer: Thanks for putting up your query at HealthCareMagic. I understand the cause of your concern. Silver nitrate is safe and if it touched the penis, there is no need to be concerned. But the cause of purple discolouration of the top the penis is not clear from the description that you have provided. I suggest that you consult your paediatrician about this. A discolored bellybutton, usually blue or purplish, is often caused by an umbilical hernia. But that is normal in newborns and you need not worry as the condition generally gets corrected on its own.

They don't hurt, but have a less smooth surface than other parts in my mouth. I felt them first about 2 weeks ago, but have grown since then.\\nAnswer: Hello,A possible explanation would be trauma from biting your cheek. You could grind your teeth at night and catch your cheek. You may damage the tissue and have some bleeding. Any difficulties with your bite with sharp edges or broken teeth? Any recent changes such as dental work, change in health care products, diet that could cause an allergic reaction? Rinse the area with warm salt water and continue to monitor for changes. If you repeat the trauma, that could explain the increase in size. I suggest you consult with your dentist. A clinical exam would provide you the best diagnosis. The concern is to rule out a serious condition such as a cancer. There are other infections possible and once diagnosed, medication may be an option to improve the condition. Your overall health needs to be reviewed with your dentist as well. Changes to your health, medications, diet, dental health etc. all need to considered.

              "  'Question: Dear Doctors, First let me say thank you for this site. It is a relief to read your quick replies and I hope i may have an answer to my concerns soon. I am a 29 year old male, 6.0 ft tall and i believe in fairly good shape. My history is that i pre hypertension, have continues tachycardia (rest bpm 100 -107), palpitations and asthma. I have seen a cardiologist about the heart rate/high blood pressure. I have been prescribed a calcium channel blocker ( i dont handle beta blockers well) as well as diagnosed with MVP. The issue is as follows: I have noticed an alarming trend that after exercising my heart rate rises to 130bpm+ for a few hours, i feel extremely faint, and extremely tired (sometimes falling asleep without wanting too). I have also noticed sudden twinge like pain near my left breast (it doesnt feel like a muscle spasm) and headaches to the point of wanting to vomit. My cardiologist is booked for a month! Any ideas or recommendations would greatly be appreciated!\\nAnswer: Hi welcome to hcmI understand your query and concern.Irregular heart beat in your case are suggestive of any arrhythmias of heart which means abnormal conduction abnormality of heart.I advise you to get an ECG,2 D Echo of your heart immediately to confirm the diagnosis.I also advise you to get lipid profile,complete blood picture,chest x ray immediately as a part of routine check up.Drugs like Amiodarone,Betaloc,Pantop 40 mg will be helpful in your case.Avoid stress and anxiety.Avoid smoking ,alcohol,fatty foods.Abnormal lipid profile if present in your case should be treated with atorvastatin.Monitor blood pressure and heart rate immediately.EP study and radiofrequency ablation will be the procedure of choice.Consult your cardiologist for expert management.Post your further queries if any,Thank you.',\n",

I often tell parents that it is normal to notice, soon after feeding, that a newborn\\'s belly is lopsided. What I mean is that it seems more full (although soft) on one side than the other. There are several reasons I think of:  the liver is bigger in proportion to the baby as a newborn, their stomach muscles aren\\'t as developed so they don\\'t tighten and clearly \"hold everything in\", the baby drinks faster than she digests so you see a big stomach after feeding then it goes down, and there isn\\'t a lot of subcutaneous fat until a few months of age, so you see and feel more in their abdomen. If your daughter is gaining and growing and having no other problems, it sounds like normal to me. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

You seem to have such pregnancy in the past. Most of the time, such pregnancy is due to unhealthy ovum. The possibility of recurrence of such pregnancy is about 10%. Normal healthy pregnancies are noted after Blighted ovum. You may report to a Foetal Medicine consultant for evaluating both of you for any chromosomal issues. This might help you in planning a healthy pregnancy. Please start consuming Folic acid daily much before you are attempting the pregnancy. This will increase the possibilities of healthy pregnancy.

I can understand your situation and problem. Keloid is type of wound healing. It is actually familial tendency. Surgical removal of Keloid is contraindicated because chances of recurrence are very high. Keloid is actually harmless and hence no treatment is required. But for cosmetic purpose, people want to remove Keloid. And for this surgery should not be done. Intra keloid steroid injections are useful in some cases. So if you have cosmetic problem with Keloid than consult dermatologist and discuss about intra Keloid steroid injection. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.',\n",

I developed acne when I first started puberty, and I picked at my face, which caused these scars. I have tried Vitamin C, and Mederma gel to lighten them, but nothing works. I want to know if there is some way to lighten them. Would Calamine lotion work perhaps anything else? How long will it take to heal completely? Am I stuck looking like this forever?\\nAnswer: Hello. I understand that you have acne scars and dark spots caused due to acne. Acne is usually age-related because of hormonal changes. However, I suggest you undergo PRP (platelet-rich plasma) therapy for the scars if they are bothering you.  For dark spots, you may use creams with Hydroquinone after consulting your dermatologist. The spots will eventually fade away with time. Avoid exposure to sun and use a sunscreen with SPF 50 while going out in the sun. I hope this answers your question.

I believe is something else it has been to long and the eye drops for the allergy has not reduce the mark.\\nAnswer: Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. By blackness do you mean a black circle around the eye, what is commonly called black eye? Let me mention that the tissue around the eyes is loose and does not contain much fat padding. As a result, in case of an injury to the forehead or any other area close by, when some amount of bleeding occurs, it gets accumulated in the loose connective area surrounding the eyes. With time as the blood becomes degraded, the colour changes from red to brown, purple, bluish and blackish. This is what gives rise to a black eye. In a week or so, it resolves spontaneously without any treatment. So, you need not worry about that. Stay relaxed.Hope I could clarify your doubt. Feel free to revert back in case of any other further queries.',\n",

Better to undergo ultrasound once to rule out possibilities like poly cystic ovary disease or any other structural abnormalities. Hormonal evaluation should be done, including thyroid profile, prolactin levels, estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH etc. With this primary workup the possible causes  for your irregular periods can be made out and treatment can be given accordingly.

              "  \"Question: Dear Doctor, my enquiry is regarding my son, he is 31 yrs old and has had juvenile diabetes since he was 23 years old. For a year now he is moody, very short tempered to the stage yelling and screaming at friends and family.Extremely prickly if questioned and gets very angry if plans have been made and then change, even if it is the slightlist change as in street direction or maybe lets go to the eatery next door instead.  Did this come from his relationship break up or is his diabetes developing into something else.  I feel he is depressed and hope it is not bipolar. He is very slim, and exercises a lot, probably not wholly following a good insulin plan.  After being very angry with me he will phone and ask he we want to go out for coffee or lunch the following day,  I see signs of the son I used to have.    Am I overreacting?  My plan if I can get him on the good day is to take him to a Diabetes specialist for a start and maybe some antidepressants for a kick start in the mornings, what do you think? Jacky\\nAnswer: !Jacky I really appreciate your efforts for the treatment for your son, and you are not overreacting at all.From what you have said in question I can say from my clinical experience that your son is having some autistic features ( as he strictly follows the same routine and throws tantrums when routine is changed). His mood swings might be related to such events as I can guess otherwise he would talk to you normally.You have not mentioned so, but such people are also strict about their dietary habits and may go to extremes patterns to follow it.The point which is against autism is that he developed this pattern just an year back and not from childhood. Such features are also seen in a condition called OCD. You have said that he looks depressed, which can be seen in OCD (comorbid depression).You have mentioned mood fluctuations in which one side is that -- he gets angry  and yells and screams but the other side is not reflective of manic features, so, I donot think that he is bipolar. however, making a correct diagnosis the psychiatrist must interview the patient herself. One thing is definite that your son needs help and I'm sure that medicines will help him a lot, more than you may even think of. So, I would suggest that you must make a visit to a psychiatrist with him. When medicine will start showing effect his diet will also improve apart from his behaviour, this will help in managing diabetes as well.You have asked if these symptoms are related to diabetes or not. Well, I have not gone across any such research work till now where diabetes itself is a cause for such symptoms in any patient. So, it looks unlikely to be so. As you have mentioned that he had a breakup, which can be taken as a stressor, I think it might be related to his current condition to some extent.Hope the reply is useful for youFeel free to ask more questionsDr. Manisha Gopal\",\n",

I am really freaked out. his mom died at 52 with bone cancer.\\nAnswer: Hello,It would be good if you do a MRI to rule out cancer as he has a genetic history.Bone shrinkage is termed as osteopenia I.e loss of bone that occurs due to low calcium in body(calcium is required for bone formation) but this is not limited to one joint or bone and is generalized in the body which is not in your caseThe black spots in the shoulder X-ray suggest bone lossthat points more toward a tumor.Hope this helps you and your husband recovers soonthank you',\n",
              "  'Question: Hi doctor, I am having red rashes on the glands of the penis. I used Candid Total and it disappeared completely. Again after seven days it again appeared and it seems red patches on right and left side of the penis. I continued using it and then got an advise form one of my friend for using Surfaz SN along with Doxt SL 100 which I am using it since last 15 days. It was improving slowly. I was using very hot water for cleaning the penis but suddenly day before yesterday, the color of the penis became red and the patches have also become red. I am having pain on the glands of the penis and seeing some white discharge. I do not know why it has happened suddenly, due to usage of hot water or for some other causes. I consulted local doctor and he advised to take LNZ 600 one tablet twice daily for five days and T-Bact ointment twice daily for 10 days. Please advise.\\nAnswer: Hi. You have erosions on the glans penis that is more consistent with candidal balanitis, other possibilities are chancroid, herpes. Please stop using Surfaz SN, it has steroid in it. Steroid helps to bring down the inflammation, itching will get better but it will not cure the fungal infection further makes the fungal infection worse. I believe that is what happened for you now. Can you please answer these questions so that I can rule out other possible conditions and suggest you appropriate medications. When did it start? Do you have similar red rash on foreskin as well? Any history of unprotected sexual intercourse? Any history of white discharge in the female partner? Did you have fluid filled blisters when it started? Is this the first time you are experiencing this kind of lesion? Do you have any allergies to medications? Do you have any other medical conditions? Diabetes? Do not use hot water for genitals. Always use lukewarm water.',\n",

Previously had 2 cortizone injections over last 1.5 yrs. for rotator cuff inflammation.  Never pain in my armpit, forearm or hand though until now. Thanks!\\nAnswer: Hi there. Firstly rotator cuff pain is more localized to the region around the shoulder. What you might be having here would probably be a nerve compression. This can happen at the level of your spinal cord, vertebrae to the many nerves supplying your hand. So if a patient presented to me that's what i would be ruling out.Especially since you mentioned that your pain is radiating, that is why i would be suspecting this all the more. You need a checkup of your right upper limb muscles to see if there is any associated weakness or any sensory loss, and a spine evaluation as well. Its also more likely if you had any history of doing any strenous activity or trauma in the recent past. So i would suggest that you get yourself evaluated for the same.\",\n",

They are tiny bumps grouped together that look somewhat white on the \"tip\". They itch a bit sometimes but not all the time. Could this be subcutaneous lupus or PLE?Thanks.\\nAnswer: Hello. Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicLE or lupus eythematosus can have varied clinical presentations on the skin. The lesions which you describe are likely to be either those of either sub acute cutaneous erythematosus (SCLE) Or Disseminated Discoid lupus erythematosus (DDLE).Classically these lesions are distributed on sun exposed sites, are scaly and may have features of atrophy as well e.g pigment loss and therefore appear white at places.Sun sensitivity and exacerbation on sun exposure are classical features of LE associated skin lesions.The lesions of LE would respond to topical potent steroids like clobetasol propionate 0.05%.Oral steroids and Antimalarials like hydroxychloroquin and chloroquin are also commonly prescribed for LE skin disease, both DLE and SCLE.It is important to emphasize here that sun protection and sunscreens are an essential part of management of LE.I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as appropriate prescription.Regards',\n",

But doctor prescribed her amixide only and they are telling no need to scan again. i wish to know Is it a serious type of cancer. and what is the survival rate.\\nAnswer: Hi,Thanks for writing in.A meningioma is a tumor arising from the covering of the brain and is usually calcified. It is important to know the size of the meningioma in the earlier scan and how long it is since that scan. If the earlier scan is less than 6 months old than doing another scan is not required.Amixide contains amitriptyline, an antidepressant and will not cause any change in the size or appearance of the meningioma. This will help relieve tension and any anxiety. It will help to know the exact location of the tumor and if it is pressing on important structures to cause headache.Survival rate for meningioma is excellent. If not removed entirely, some meningiomas might recur and this can be treated again by radiation therapy. Please do not worry.',\n",

Although metformin is generally well tolerated, patients taking metformin may develop gastrointestinal side effects even after many years of use. If gastrointestinal symptoms develop while taking metformin, we institute a metformin holiday, which may lead to resolution of symptoms. after a period of non use, metformin may be successfully resumed at the same or a lower dose with slow titration of the immediate-release or extended release formulation.You can let him stop taking metformin.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of heart block is more in your friend's case. It is conduction defect in heart when impulses are regularly conducted. So heart is not beating properly and hence blood circulation in the body is also not proper. Pace maker insertion is must for him. If he is not willing for pace maker, he may develop brain damage (paralysis) due to decreased blood supply to brain. Sudden stoppage of heart is also seen due to heart block.

She took one TT injection on the left side of the buttock and two painkiller injections on the 28th n 29th on the right side of the buttock. Yesterday she had a sudden severe pain on both sides of the buttocks at the injection spot with a hard swelling node and with high temperature as per now. Please suggest is anything serious. And she had her abortion on the 23rd as well with heavy bleeding. Please kindly request you to advise us.\\nAnswer: Hello. Now, here the first possibility is of the infection of the injection site. The signs and symptoms which further suggests the injection site infections are the presence of swelling, reddish discoloration around the site, any pus point visible, the site is little warm compared to the nearby area, pain on pressing the area which was not there one to two days back. Is this swelling new? I meant was it there a day or two before? So look for these signs. It is not serious but gets to be treated early. It is better, once you get examined by her treating doctor. And also she will need antibiotics for it and on confirming the infection, capsule Moxiclav (Amoxicillin plus Clavulanate combination) 625 mg three times a for five days along with some antacids. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Avoid pain killers till we confirm. If she needs one, she can have Paracetamol 500 mg up to four times a day. Do hot water fomentation over the swelling. Another possibility is the presence of blood clot there which can also cause fever and it will be resolved with time. Is uterine bleeding still continued, any pus discharge through the vagina? Any pain over the lower abdomen? This is to rule out infection of the uterus post-abortion. So it is important that you once get her examined by treating doctor. If possible you should upload the photo of hard swelling for a better understanding of the problem. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

This happened 8 days ago we have been to A&E and had him checked fully with eye tests at the eye hospital which are all clear. He still complains of blurred vision, shapes in his eyes and they are light sensitive what should we do?\\nAnswer: Hi... Blurred vision even after so many days of head injury means that he is having an intracranial problem.

I went through your details.I suggest you not to worry much. The symptom you are mentioning does not point to short term memory loss. It could just be selective forgeting. Your brain hs the capacity to forget something which you do not want to remember. The same thing happens in the case of undue anxiety and restlessness.

My husband is only 61 and I am tempted to try herbs and other things if that might help along with cleansing of the liver. What do you think ?\\nAnswer: Hello, The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) system was implemented on February 27, 2002 to prioritize patients waiting for a liver transplant. MELD is a numerical scale used for adult liver transplant candidates. If the doctors say that your husband is much more sicker than the actual MELD score,then it is very serious. There is no herbal medicine with proven scientific evidence,which can cure a end stage liver disease.There is no point opting for herbal medicine as that may deteriorate the condition even more.There is no way by which liver can be cleansed. You must try to get the liver transplant done as early as possible,as that is the only scientific and proven way,which can cure your husband. Thanks',\n",

I clean my tongue daily.. but then also My tongue has become thick , whitish layer is present on it + when i open my mouth bad breath or smell comes out.Apart from all these now a days i am not able to pronounce words likereached the ed in it ghosts when i say ghosts shhhh kind of sound comes out & many more words I'll be very thankful if u can help me with this\\nAnswer: Hello,Possible reasons for a coating on the tongue include:-yeast infection, thrush-gastric upset-acid reflux-mouth with soft tissue infection-dental abscess draining from a tooth-periodontal disease-mouth breathing-dry mouth-other medications or health issuesBad breath can be associated with these conditions. An increase in the size of your tongue due to inflammation can affect your speech. A growth or tumor is possible. Other disease states can have side effects that could affect the function of your tongue. I am glad that you clean your tongue daily. Be sure to practice good daily dental care. Warm salt water rinses have a cleansing and soothing effect. Be sure to keep well hydrated, proper nutrition, and balanced vitamins. You describe a change in the size of your tongue which could indicate swelling. You should rule out an allergic reaction. Think of any changes you may have made such as using a new dental product or change in your diet. Eliminate any possibilities and evaluate the result.You can try some anti-inflammatory medications such as acetaminophen and advil. An antihistamine such as benedryl may help, but can make you tired.  These may reduce your symptoms and offer some relief.There are oral rinses that may be helpful such as chlorohexidine gluconate which reduces bacteria in the mouth or betamethasone sodium phosphate which is a corticosteroid used to reduce mouth soreness.You should schedule a dental exam. A routine exam and cleaning will evaluate your dental health. Periodontal disease and dental infections must be ruled out. Your dentist will review your overall health. Antibiotics or precription medication may be needed. A diagnosis will be needed to decide the best treatment. You want to evaluate for a more serious condition and possible need for a physical or blood tests. I hope this information offers you some relief and thank you for your inquiry.\",\n",

              "  'Question: I am an 18 year old female, 5\"4, and I weigh 182 pounds. Recently I was suffering some flu like symptoms and my doctor prescribed me amoxicillin 250mg. After finishing the amoxicillin I started to have bad earache so they then prescribed pseudoephedrine to unblock catarrh in my ears but it doesn\\'t seem to be working and now all my previous symptoms have also come back. What is going on?\\nAnswer: I read your question carefully and I understand your concern. First of all, if you had just flu like symptoms, it is usually a viral infection (not a bacterial one) and antibiotic treatment is not effective and not recommended. I believe with flu like symptoms you mean runny or stuffy nose, cough and/or sore throat, headaches and/or body aches, fever 100F (37.8C) or more. In this case you need only supportive therapy, like drinking fluids like water or electrolyte beverages to prevent dehydration. Covering up with blanket to calm chills, resting a lot, gargling salt water to soothe a sore throat. To alleviate stuffy nose, sinuses, ears and chests, to reduce fevers and discomfort you can use decongestants and/ore antihistamines (e.g TAYLOL HOT which has has analgesic (pain relieving), antipyretic (reduce high body temperature), antihistamine (anti-allergic) effects) or other NSAID drugs. If your symptoms persist or are getting worse, than it is a possibility you might have a bacterial infection, for which you require broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. In your case you have also a bad earache, which can be a sign of acute inflammation of middle ear, so you probably need antibiotics and supportive therapy, but you should consult your family doctor and/or ENT doctor, in order to evaluate more objectively your situation. I hope my answer helped you.Wishing you a good health',\n",

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months).

The fact that your eyelids get stuck together on waking up in the morning suggests that you are having infective conjunctivitis. Although Pred Forte (Prednisolone) would have helped earlier on, it is now likely to worsen the condition. I recommend that you re-visit your ophthalmologist.

I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) first because this can cause similar symptoms and if not treated promptly, this arrhythmia can be life threatening. So consult doctor and get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia. Stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out arrhythmia. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks\",\n",

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.PLEASE DO NOT GIVE ANY SO CALLED APPETITE STIMULANTS AS THEY ARE NOT VERY SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN AND THEY HAVE THE SIDE EFFECT OF EXCESSIVE DROWSINESS.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

              "  \"Question: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.\\nAnswer: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I am taking Amoxicillin\\xa0for a lingering cold. Yesterday, I experienced a sharp pain on my left side, under my armpit, equal with my left breast. I had this episode of pain twice yesterday.

When I\\xa0put my hand on the area it felt as though something was passing through my ribs and once it passed the pain subsided and I\\xa0was fine.\\xa0There was a bit of tenderness in the region of pain.

I wanted to wait and see if it happened again, but was looking for a second opinion on that. Both my grandparents passed away because of heart attack and so, I am worried. I am a mother of two kids and do not want there to be an issue.\\nAnswer: Hi. I understand your concern as your grandparents passed of a heart attack, the fear you have is genuine. But, just pain in your chest is not an indication of a heart attack. Since you gave a history of carbonated food and tablet Amoxicillin along with thyroid medication, these both can cause an acid reflux and that can cause heartburn and lead to such non-specific pain. However, if the pain was associated with sweating and stabbing character or constricting type with radiation to the left arm, then it is always better to get an ECG done to see if it is related to your heart. Heartburn. ECG. For further information consult an internal medicine physician online.--->',\n",

              "  'Question: Hi, I am a 35 yrs old married man having a 5 yrs old son. I am having tight foreskin problem due to which i am unable to enjoy sex. Below is my sex history after marriage: I was able to pull back my foreskin when penis is in normal state.Before going for intercourse i manually pull back my foreskin with force and it gets stuck behing the glans and once done with intercourse then within no time i used to cover my penis with the foreskin.That way my sex life was going on although not very healthy as my penis is very very sensitive.In 2009 i went to a Doctor and he scolded me with dare consequences in this way of doing sex.He said no need to pull back the foreskin and just do sex with foreskin.Since than i have been using condom for doing sex.As now i am planning for my 2nd baby hence i am worried how to do sex without condom with the fear that if i do sex with foreskin and it stuck back than what will happen. As i am 35 yr old now hence not sure if foreskin stretching exercise will work for me. Please suggest. Thanks in advance.\\nAnswer: Hi,Thanks for your question and detailed description of your problem.The only suggestion I can give you is to get partial circumcision surgery done. In this, we cut part of the foreskin with the end result of having the glans penis covered with partial foreskin and while in the erect state it will get uncovered naturally without any pain. Also, it will decrease the sensitivity you have over your glans. Think about it and consult a Surgeon or a Reconstructive Surgeon if you so decide to get it operated.Take care,Dr Rishi, New Delhi, India.',\n",

              "  'Question: Hello doctor, Four months before I found that I have thyroid with high TSH 18. Then I put off some weight and did morning walk and running, then it decreases to 14. Now I left the exercise because I met with an accident. Now I have done my test again it was 18 again. Now I consulted the doctor but he said that I have to take medicines lifelong. It was really shocking for me and he prescribed me Thyrox 50 mg and Pure D3 60000 iu for four weeks and Rabeprazole 20 mg. But I am nervous and confused about taking this drug because I read somewhere that once you started taking this drug it will replace your thyroid hormones. Then you have to take the medicines life long. My weight is 80 kg, BP 110/180 mmHg, T3-0.98, T4-7.62 and TSH 15.98. Now kindly suggest me what should I do? Is it necessary to take the drug or is there any alternative? Please help.\\nAnswer: Hello. First of all, you must have to understand the problem. You are suffering from medical condition called hypothyroidism. In this condition, the thyroid hormone production decreases. Thyroid hormone is necessary for the metabolism of the body and in the absence of this hormone body metabolic rate reduces and the person starts gaining weight. When thyroxine hormone decreases, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) increases which trigger the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone (T3, T4), and raised TSH level in the blood is a diagnostic factor, this is raised in your case. Management: We have to give thyroid hormone preparation in the form of thyroxine which comes under various brand names like Thyrox and this is necessary for body metabolism. Otherwise, you will have to suffer from some other medical problems, so it is advisable to continue this medicine as advised by your doctor until your TSH level become normal. Then you can again consult your treating doctor or us for further plans until then you must take it. Frankly speaking, there is no alternative to this. Here I noticed that your BP (blood pressure) is 110/180 mmHg. It is surprising that the diastolic is more than systolic. I think there is some typing error so again check your BP and tell, as this is suggestive of that you are hypertensive too, so you must start some anti-hypertensive medications. Rabeprazole is medicine for hyper-acidity. Advise: Weight reduction and salt restriction.',\n",

Here climate is dry and surrounding temperature is almost 43-44 degree centigrade. Can this hot and dry weather be reason for his fever? What should I do? Your reply should be highly appreciated.\\nAnswer: Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

I have a flying travel planed on 25th this month and I fly back on the 9th. Is it safe to travel?\\nAnswer: Hello. You are in your 19th week of gestation with a low lying placenta (just 1.9 cm from the os - placental margin). Ideally, 2.5 cm from os is considered safe. So, travel with flight or any other mode is not recommended in your case presently. Also, an absolute no to intercourse as well as this may cause threatened miscarriage/antepartum hemorrhage due to jerks or exertion while traveling. Usually, the placenta naturally climbs up by 32 weeks of gestation when the lower segment of the uterus starts forming. So, presently you have to be careful and if the trip is avoidable, it should be avoided. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->',\n",

He has had a brain scan which is clear and also a bone scan. He is 70 years old and was a builder so he has got some wear and tear on his bones etc. Any ideas as to what could be causing this pain.? lewis.\\nAnswer: Hi, As the CT scan of brain is normal probably organic causes can be ruled out specially at this stage chance of brain metastasis is high. You should have to note the type, intensity, frequency, duration and relieving/aggravating factors related to headache. If the headache is associated with vomiting then this should be carefully investigated. other type of headache like cluster or tension headache should also be kept in mind.

I suggest you not to worry much. From the description, it is not enough to diagnose. Tiredness is due to laziness (if not otherwise diagnosed). People like to do nothing if there is an option. But we do a lot of work. We can't think of sitting idle for more than half an hour. That is because we are agile. but lazy people are habituated to sit idle and do nothing. Naturally they become lazy. Lazy mind is devil's workshop and other behavioral problems like anger, aggression, irritability etc follow. The best method to get rid of all these problems are to compulsorily engage yourself in activities. Go for a job. That shall change you.If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible.

I can understand your concern. Beclazone is having beclomethasone. It is inhaled corticosteroid. It actually treatment of choice for asthma. It is very safe and having least side effects. These are possible because beclomethasone is given locally (as inhaler) and not systemically. So drug will deposit directly in the lungs without reaching to other organs and hence systemic side effects are very less with inhaled beclomethasone. You just need to rinse your mouth after its use to prevent drug deposition in pharynx. So don't worry about long term side effects of Beclazone. It is having excellent safety on long run.

              "  'Question: Hello doctor, I am a 66-year-old male with a weight of 90 kg and a height of 175 cms. For the last four months, I am continuously facing the following problems. Moderate sore throat, feeling like a lump in my deep throat, gastric reflux, poor digestion, a feeling of air blocked in both the ears and popping sound on swallowing. After treatment, these symptoms subside for some time. But now I have deviated septum. Presently I have sticky mucus discharge from the nose in postnasal mode. Sometimes I also feel stress in the jaws. Due to continuous popping in ears (mostly left ear) and lump feeling in the throat, I am unable to sleep properly. This is having an adverse effect on my health. I am on medication for almost three months on and off, including Levocetirizine one tablet twice daily and Fluticasone spray. I also take Rabeprazole DSR for the reflux issue, steam inhalation, and saline gargles. But symptoms sometimes abate and again come up. I regularly take Bisoprolol and Metformin and glimperamide for few years. Due to soreness in the throat, popping in the ears, and continuous cough, I am unable to sleep. The sticky mucus is viscous and salty in taste and discharges in the throat. RTF test showed partial dysfunction of the left eustachian tube. What could be the likely causes and line of treatment to get rid of this? Could it be due to air pollution or some other allergy source? Due to continuous coughing, my abdominal muscles are paining, and there is a split voice in my throat. It appears like there is an overproduction of mucus all over the respiratory tract. I have started taking antibiotic Augmentin eight hours once for the last four days, but no relief. Please advise.\\nAnswer: Hello.

Acne is a disorder of pilosebaceous unit - pilo meaning hair, and sebaceous glands meaning oil producing glands. The oil produced from these sebaceous glands is expelled out from the duct out onto the skin. If there is a blockage in the duct, oil accumulates and starts irritating surrounding skin causing comedones (black and whiteheads). For your acne grade, I would suggest you use: Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start using the medicines with their consent. I wish you get rid of this condition soon.

I went into the bathroom and check if I see any hole but there is none. I gargle with some warm salt water but it still does not stop. I brushed my teeth but I cannot go up to where the gum is because it hurts. When I eat food I do not have a problem with it but only when I touch it I feel pain. I do not know what is causing this and I am wondering if it is my sinus. But, I know that I have tooth decay because when I eat certain food my molar and premolar hurts. I have an appointment to see the dentist but it is not in the recent upcoming days.\\nAnswer: Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. Pain on pressure is a clear sign of an infection deep in the roots of your upper incisors. It could be mostly because of a forgotten trauma or assault you had in your childhood. It is not necessarily because of tooth decay. The vital part of the tooth is suffering pressure and causing the infection. I advise you to visit the dentist on an emergency appointment immediately and you got to check with an x-ray to proceed with a root canal treatment in my opinion. Your appointment would be too late and you cannot be on Paracetamol for so long. There are a lot of chances for a bigger swelling or discoloration of the tooth. It is not related to sinusitis as you think and the pain you get in premolar and molar region is the referred pain that you feel because of the upper incisors. Meanwhile, try not to bite any hard object or food and gently brush with a soft-bristle toothbrush. Thank you.',\n",

My foreskin is a real mess as she had to remove a section of skin to return it to its original position. I have noticed that there seems to be a lot of blood clotting right at the end of the foreskin and the foreskin still seems a little swollen. Also when I urinate, it flows out between the stitches, instead of flowing out where it normally would. I am just wondering whether these things are normal or whether I need to go back to the hospital to get them to check up on it. Also I am concerned that if I have an erection in my sleep, the paraphimosis will occur again. Is this a legitimate concern for someone who has just had this surgery?\\nAnswer: Hi, For swollen foreskin you can use MgSo4 solution with bandage around foreskin. Apply antiseptic cream like soframycine over stitches. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Other causes can be diseases associated with cervical disc disease (may be associated with neck posture-related issues). It could be associated with some diseases of the ear(infection or neuritis). Besides this, there are simpler causes like anemia (low hemoglobin), hypoglycemia (low sugar), prolonged fasting, low blood pressure, vitamin deficiency, stress, anxiety, or lack of proper sleep. Hence, I feel- Take a well-balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables. Maintain proper posture especially while working and sleeping and take good sleep for 7-8 hours.She can even start to take some multivitamins. But If still the symptoms persist then do go for some investigations like- (complete blood count, vitamin B12, vitamin D, sugar levels, electrolytes, ECG and X-ray cervical spine) most important will be MRI Brain. This will help us to make a proper diagnosis and plan proper treatment. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

              "  'Question: Hi Doctor! My brother is suffering from Psychosis . He has been advices to take Clozapine 100mg to 300mg. however, when we have administered him 100mg clozapine, he is not able to even do any activity for more than 5 minutes. he is drowsy, tired , does not even want to step out of house.. Another doctor on seeing these symptoms reduced the dosage to 50mg daily and added joykem & parkin 2mg to it. all these medicines have not cured him and seems have dangerous sideffects. Earlier Oleanzapine was been adminitered to him (before clozapine for nearly 5 years).Dr can you please advice as how much time dosuch patients take to be perfectly ok ? and whether these are right medications to be given?? The problem faced by patient is: Not been able to concentrate, to continue his course beyond 1 year, carry out daily work like bathing, brushing etc.,taking initiative, thinking maturely. He does not hallucinate or hear any voices. He does not want to talk also\\nAnswer: I dont think only for those above symptoms he need too many drugs like clozapine, parkin(trihexyphenidyl), joykem. There must be some other features of psychosis. A detailed mental evaluation is needed. Any way the drug is right for psychosis but symptoms are not verifying the diagnosis. Please go and consult a good psychiatrist. Or you may give a detailed history and course of illness otherwise it is very difficult to comment on the medicine.',\n",

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

Recently I've been having dizzy spells, I feel at times for example I've stopped the car but its still moving, I've been also experiencing pins and needles in my hands on and off and had 1 near faint! I'm wondering what it could be? I hate visiting the dr as I feel a fraud going thank\\nAnswer: Hello, and thanks for visiting Healthcare Magic! Two of the symptoms that you describe (the dizziness and the episode of almost fainting) could very likely be caused by the same problem.  The list of things that can cause a near-fainting episode (referred to by doctors as pre-syncope) is long.  Two of the most common are dehydration and arrythmias. Dehydration is caused most frequently either by not drinking enough, or by losing too much water.  This type of loss can occur from diarrhea, profuse sweating (as in exercising in hot weather), or other reasons.  There is no set amount of water that everyone needs on a daily basis.  You should drink when you feel thirsty, or if you notice that your urine is dark in color (it should always either be clear or a very pale yellow color). Arrhythmias occur when the heart does not beat in its normal rhythm.  Some arrythmias are benign, others can be more dangerous, and some can even be life threatening.  One of the first things a doctor will do for any patient that has fainted, or almost fainted, is an EKG.  This allows us to determine if the electrical activity in the heart is abnormal, as would be seen in an arrhythmia. I recommend that you make an appointment with a doctor to be examined for this problem.  The 'pins and needles' in your hands are likely unrelated, and it's difficult to say without asking you a great deal more questions what could be causing this. I hope I have given you some useful information, and wish you the best of health. Sincerely, Dr. Kinney\",\n",

He has had a few little scrapes lately that seem to take longer than normal to heal, but other than that, no changes in overall health. What could be going on? Thanks, Amanda\\nAnswer: Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern. As per your query your child have symptoms of  red swollen bumps on the legs .Well there can be many reasons for symptoms you mention in query like haematoma , lipoma , fibroma , cellulitis and abscess. But in your case it seems to me that the lump is due to persistence of bacterial infection of hair follicle and due to underlying systemic pathology. Need not to worry. I would suggest you to clean the lump with soap and normal water , apply warm compresses and take benadryl twice a day . You should apply antibacterial ointment such as betnovate on it twice daily. If it doesn't get better then consult dermatologist for proper examination to prevent condition like septicemia . Doctor may check the consistency . Doctor may drain the lump , prescribe antibiotics , anti allergic and anti inflammatory.

My past medical or surgical history is rather unremarkable. I have had several bouts of acute sinusitis in years past. Four\\xa0weeks ago, my wife and I developed URTI. My illness had a sinus component featuring marked nasal and sinus congestion, postnasal drip, upper airway congestion and cough productive of clear sputum. I assumed the etiology was viral and treated it as such. After two weeks of little improvement, I assumed a bacterial etiology and initiated Augmentin 875 mg bid. After five days with little improvement, I switched to Cipro 500 mg bid. After four days, I saw my primary care doctor who prescribed Azithromycin 500 mg per day. Following the second day of treatment, I developed severe fatigue, generalized weakness and headache, which forced me to discontinue the Azithromycin. I then decided to wait until the Zithromax cleared my system before re-evaluating. After some eight days, I developed a purulent nasal discharge for which I again saw my primary care MD who prescribed Doxycycline 100 mg bid. Note that I requested a culture and sensitivity of the purulent discharge but was rebuffed. After 24 hours on Doxycycline, I felt greatly improved with little sinus pressure or congestion and minimal, clear nasal discharge. Now, on day four of Doxycycline, I have noted some return of the sinus pressure, post-nasal drip and nasal congestion. However, the mucus is clear. I was given a steroid nasal spray which only served to increase the mucosal irritation of my sinuses, nasal passages, throat and upper airways. I was never febrile at any point. I am exceedingly frustrated. Note that in the past I used Levaquin and developed marked insomnia and very lucid dreams when I was able to sleep. Please help.\\nAnswer: Hi. We are here to help you. You are suffering from chronic sinusitis. And I feel this is all allergic and you do not need antibiotics. Usually an acute attack takes five days to settle down. But, if you have persisting sinusitis, you would require CT paranasal sinuses. If the CT shows slight sinus infection, then it can be treated with conservative treatment. But, if the infection is severe, you would require surgery for the same. The conservative management of sinusitis includes the following: Please share my opinion with your doctor before acting upon it. I hope it helps.

While it is very important to be on acitrom for you to prevent thrombotic complications in pregnancy, it is equally important to prevent significant malformations in the baby due to acitrom. Please consider the following facts.1. The fact that you were on acitrom says you must have had mechanical prosthetic valve replacement rather bio prosthetic valve where anti coagulation may not be required at all.2. The use of any anticoagulants in pregnancy is a risk for bleeding at the placental site and subsequent miscarriage, preterm birth and low birth weight in the baby. In such a circumstance, using acitrom ( warfarin) in the first trimester poses further risk of malformations in the baby. And hence once pregnancy is detected, acitrom is usually replaced with either low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin till 12 to 13 weeks to avoid teratogenicity. As acitrom is the best anticoagulant used to prevent thrombotic complications ( the risk for blood clotting in pregnancy is magnified 6 fold), it can be restarted following 12 weeks or continued with heparin depending on physician judgement. However, one must know that the risk for valvular thrombosis increases about 7% if only heparin is used during this period.3. Although it is very hard to determine the effects of acitrom on baby so early, as you have discontinued it in the very early stage and the dose is less 5mg) there may not be any harm on the baby. But I must warn you that you need to see your doctor for a detailed discussion and for anticoagulant replacement with heparin which is of utmost importance till 12 weeks following which you can be on warfarin again. Continued therapy during breast feeding is safe and encouraged. Hope this helped. Take care.',\n",

Bacterial throat infection will have to be treated by some antibiotics. However, during pregnancy, certain antibiotics like Tetracycline are not advised due to their teratogenicity. Hence, take antibiotics only with the advice of Obstetrician. In addition, avoid cold and chilled food or drinks. Hot gargles with salt water or Listerine solution will help you. Half teaspoonful of turmeric powder and 2 tsf of sugar in a glassful of hot water will help bring down the infection. Ignoring the infection may spread in the body through blood.

I can understand your concern. No need to worry for histoplasma infection. This is unlikely cause for your chest pain. In my opinion, you are mostly having musculoskeletal pain due to  blunt chest trauma because of fall. So better to avoid strenuous exercise and heavyweight lifting.

Belching, pain in center of chest and left leg tingeling.\\nAnswer: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. First of all no need to worry for heart diseases as your ecg and 2d echo are normal. Belching and central chest pain are seen in GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.. Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination twice daily before food. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\",\n",

Your clinical situation is very complicated, because colitis can cause irradiating back pain. Tarlov cysts usually are asymptomatic and do not need treatment. But in a case like yours, if the erosion of L3 is near the cyst and not because of osteoporosis, I would recommend to consult with a neurosurgeon for the possibility or treatment.

Treatment is not usually needed, as most men do not have any symptoms or problems caused by the varicocele. If there are symptoms symptomatic treatment is recommended- scrotal support or analgesics according to the symptom.If required, an operation can clear a varicocele. Some methods that can be used are venous ligation or embolization with a success rate 90%-95%, laparoscopic surgery (expensive but better for bilateral procedures) or radiologic embolization via groin catheter (expensive, good for recurrent varicocele).However, remember that most men with a varicocele are not infertile.Take care,Regards.\",\n",

I even went back to the original doctor that made the diagnosis but his office said he can t give the referral because it s been over two years since the original doctor has seen him. HELP!\\nAnswer: PKD is genetic kidney disease, so if we find a treatment which can eradicate PKD, our children will be free from this disease. However, how to eradicate PKD? Actually, not every person with PKD gene will definitely suffer this disease. For some people, they may live with PKD gene for a life-long time without have any kidney damages. Although this case is rare, it exists truly. Once PKD occurs, it is almost impossible for us to eradicate radically, because we have no methods to remove all the cysts from kidneys. Surgery is the traditional treatment for PKD and it treats PKD through breaking big cysts. We know PKD means there are countless cysts in the kidneys and surgery only can remove several cysts in one time, so it is impractical for us to eradicate PKD through surgery.TREATMENT TRE As for treatment for PKD, Immunotherapy is worth trying. Immunotherapy combines Chinese medicines and Stem Cell Treatment which are separately applied to shrinking cysts and increasing renal functions.',\n",

Then I went to the bathroom and a blood clot passed through my urine and the toilet bowl filled with blood. I do not really have the pregnancy symptoms as much as I did before, but what could this be?\\nAnswer: Hello. As the pregnancy tests were negative even after eight days post missed menses, it ensures that you are not pregnant. The symptoms you had were common PMS symptoms (premenstrual syndrome), which subsides slowly once the menses start. There is a possibility that a large endometrial chunk would have got passed out during the start of the flow due to delayed menses this time. So, just allow the menses to continue and you should be fine. The chunk was definitely not a gestational sac or pregnancy, as the pregnancy tests were negative.

As we know, plaquenil is not the first drug of choice for Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is a very mild drug when it comes to RA and i doubt it will be able to control your RA as a single drug alone. Maybe you had Lupus since the beginning as it is a very close mimic to RA. These rashes which are triggered in the sun are a common sign in Lupus, it is known as Photosenstivity. I am not sure if your ANA was done initially. You can check your ANA and ENA Profile once if it hasnt been done. Try using a good sunscreen if the Protecting Factor of more than 50. I hope the information was useful\",\n",

If the satrogyl 300 tablet is useful for this problem, as her doctor had suggested this medicine once she was suffering some allergy problem.  I am from India\\nAnswer: Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history.Satrogyl 300 is used for treating some worm infestations. Although some worms can cause itching and urticaria, there are other causes also.So first I would suggest your wife to take montelukast and levocetirizine for at least 3-5 days depending upon response. However, if she has severe swelling, swelling inside throat, feeling of suffocation, or other trouble symptoms, she may require a short course of corticosteroids.Regarding Satrogyl, it will work only if her symptoms are due to worms, not if they are due to any other cause.Hope this will be helpful to you and solves your query.Wish your wife a quick recovery and the best of the health.Should you have any further query, please fell free to ask at HCM.Regards.Dr Parin N Parmar',\n",

Aprazolam is a sedative and anti anxiety drug . This is one medication you should try to wean off . At least the morning dose . However as you are taking for 5 years it has to tapered very slowly.  Your risk factor is obesity and till you lose weight it remains . So continuation of medication is a safer alternative.

Sometimes it is just sore and sometimes it is a bit sharper. What could this be.? I have exercised regularly for years so I son t think it is a pulled muscle.\\nAnswer: Hi three. The lower back pain on your right lower side could be either a trigger point over a muscle which can be treated easily with manipulation and massaging. Now the nature of pain is what is more important. If you are having a lower back pain which is radiating all along the side then it might need some evaluation, as that is a red flag sign; given the prior history of liver and pancreatic cancer. A trigger point is a relatively small localized area of tenderness in the soft tissue. So go for a trigger point release from a physiotherapist and see how it helps.',\n",

              "  'Question: Hello, I was in Cuba about a month ago and there was a lot of walking involved, no problems. On my 3 hour flight home, during the landing, I had a bad muscle cramp on the lower left side of my calf on the left leg. It was stiff and sore after, so when I got off the plane I checked it out. I noticed a small lump just under where the cramp had occurred. My wife thought it was a DVT. So i whent for two ultrasounds different days and a blood test. Nothing came up. It has been a month now and the lump is still there, longer instead of a bump, the calf get stiff with exercise and a bit sore, also sometimes I has smaller muscle spams in the same spot. Any idea? Thank you. Justin.\\nAnswer: hi You had a bad muscle cramp after 3 hr flight from Cuba. Thereafter you noticed a lump jst above the site of cramps, which is not going away , and it is not DVT. In my opinion , you probably have  a condition called popliteal cyst from knee . When it ruptured after flight , you had severe pain in the leg , as cramps. Get an ultrasound / MRI . It will have to be removed,if present,',\n",

Can u give me a natural solution for this problem.\\nAnswer: Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Eosinophils are marker of allergic disease. Their count rise in allergic conditions like asthma, skin allergy etc. Your son is also having chronic cough which is not subsided by routine medicines. So possibility of allergic cough due to asthma is more. So get done clinical examination of respiratory system by pediatrician. He needs anti histamine and anti allergic drugs. These will surely improve his cough and lower down eosinophil count. Hope, I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.',\n",

              "  'Question: Hello. My question is why would I have an elevated ASO titer for over 6 months. It s only slightly elevated 232 - 220 - 238. But I have had penicillin shot, rocephin, amoxicillin, and Augmentin. It all began because I had significant bilateral joint pain, blood in my urine, unexplained weight loss, continuous mouth sores. All of it occurred after having my first child. Before that I had no medical issues. Was thought to have RA at first because my brother has Felty Syndrome. Went to rheumatologist. Thought I could have lupus bc my monocytes were high and my WBC were low. But all labs for lupus were negative. Now told I have viral arthritis. Still have bilateral joint pain but feel much better. I did have elevated CRP of 14. RA factor was 8.4. Now both are lowered but my aso was 238 and the highest it has been after all those antibiotics. Also I am 37 and had a baby 13 months ago. I had to do invitro related unexplained infertility but later revealed I had high FSH. Still had a successful implantation and pregnancy.\\nAnswer: Thank you for asking!  ASO titre  greater than 166 Todd units (or >200 IU) is considered a positive test. This upper limit of normal may vary from lab to lab and by age, with it being higher in school-aged children.  A positive test can indicate recent or current group A, C, and G streptococcal infection (eg, upper airway infections, scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome) and may support the diagnosis of post-streptococcal infection complication (eg, glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever).  As you already had too much multifactorial issues so a complete clinical correlation is necessary to connect the dots here.Take care',\n",

I've got a few spots on my chin but can't tell if they're just spots due to blocked pores or if I've caught chickenpox. Apart from these spots I've not had any other symptoms associated with the chickenpox. How can I tell if these spots are chickenpox or just acne type spots?\\nAnswer: Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.The classic symptom of chickenpox is a rash that turns into itchy, fluid-filled blisters that eventually turn into scabs. The rash may first show up on the face, chest, and back then spread to the rest of the body.Other typical symptoms that may begin to appear 1 to 2 days before rash include fever, headache, tiredness, and loss of appetite.Most people who have had chickenpox will not get it again because they are immune to it for life. However, rarely some people who have had chickenpox will develop a related condition called shingles later on.As per above statement, it is less likely that you have chickenpox. However, I advise you to consult your doctor for proper clinical examination.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Mohammed Taher Ali\",\n",

Bowel movement and urge to evacuate are the signals given to child by the body and they pick the signals and act accordingly. This happens when the urge is specific.

Will the doctor knows i masturbated? I know its normal etc.. Sorry for my grammar but apprechiate ur help! Thanks, Tom\\nAnswer: Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Regarding your concern, I would explain that sexual intercourse is evaluated as a medium intensity physical activity. Masturbation is a similar activity. It may lead to some tachycardia, but nothing special. You can take note of the time and refer it as running or jumping. There is no way the doctor can know what you are doing at that moment. Hope you will find this answer helpful!',\n",

How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?\\nAnswer: Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

I JUST GAVE HIM HIS CLINDOMYCIN ABOUT AN HOUR AGO AND ONE MOTRIN ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO.  WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP HIM WITH THE SWELLING?\\nAnswer: Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.UNDERSTANDING YOUR CONCERN.Brief answer - Facial Space InfectionDetailed answer - As per your query swelling and pain in cheek after having abscessed tooth drainage is because dental infection or pus formation started in tooth and from there it reached  pulp and from there it reached jaw bone. From jaw it is spreading into soft tissue such as muscle, skin and spreading out to facial spaces and growing there. I would suggest you to take antibiotics such as Ibuprofen/ Augmentin for this as it will prevent infection and pain and swelling will be subsided. Cold compress the cheek area. Visit dentist once again and get X-ray done to check if all the abscess has been drained completely or still pus is there. Get RCT done for infected tooth after complete drainage of pus. Do warm rinses after ever two hours. Continue brushing and flossing.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari\",\n",

I have had 4 csections ( 3 live 1 deceased) in the past 5 years. I currently found out that i am pregnant but unsure of how far along i am. I did not want to get pregnant and was taking care of myself as much as possible. I am scared due to the fact that i was high risk in my last two pregnancies. As much as i love my kids i cannot have another one and the dr. that attended me on my last csection repeated to me that i could not have another one because it could be extremely dangerous. I do not know what to do, i have not told anybody and i feel like im in a hole that i cant get out of. What do you suggest i should do ? If you could please respond to me at YYYY@YYYY . Thank you for your time.\\nAnswer: Dear Adriana,I do empathize your situation. Pregnancy after 4 Caesarean sections does carry a very high risks of rupture of the uterus during delivery and even sometimes during pregnancy, retained placenta after delivery if it is implanted over the scar, post delivery bleeding, etc.. If you are under 9 weeks of pregnancy and are sure that you do not want to continue with this pregnancy, you may opt for termination of pregnancy by medicines which carries very low risk even after caesarean section. WHO has recommended two regimes for such terminations:1. Tab. Mifepristone to be followed after 24-48 hours by Tab. Misoprostol 2. Tab. Misoprostol only regime: Tab. Misoprostol every 3-12 hours for up to 3 dosesThese are very effective and safe methods for terminating pregnancy up to 9 weeks of gestation. It is advisable to ensure the completeness of abortion by ultrasonography. These medicines are prescription medicines and need to be procured by Gynaecologists prescription only. They should be taken as per  the instructions of Gynaecologist. These medicines cause developmental abnormalities in the baby; hence the pregnancy should not be continued if the medicines fail to abort; then the pregnancy should be terminated by surgical methods like MVA aspiration. Since you are having 4 previous Caesarean sections, it will carry some extra risk; however under expert supervision, this can be carried out fairly safely. If you decide to continue with this pregnancy (which I would not advise), you will have to be under continuous supervision of Obstetrician. The integrity of the scan may be assessed by repeated frequent ultrasonography. Any discomfort over the lower abdomen should be reported to the Obstetrician immediately. You may have to be in the hospital during last month of your pregnancy. This will have to be a planned caesarean delivery. This delivery has to be a hospital delivery. Please maintain your health. Keep your haemoglobin within normal range by regular consumption of iron and high protein diet. Please visit the Obstetrician for antenatal care more frequently and follow the advise religiously. I hope you got the messages.',\n",

I can understand your concern. Fever with chills in bronchitis patients are suggestive of lung infection like pneumonia. Since you had heavy smoking habit in the past and now suffering from bronchitis, your lungs are weak and prone for infection. So we should rule out pneumonia first. So consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system2. Chest x ray 3. Complete blood count. Chest x ray is must for the diagnosis of pneumonia.

              "  'Question: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?\\nAnswer: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill.

              "  'Question: My symptoms started about a year ago, i was woken up suddenly in the middle of the night, it all happened so quick i jumped straight up and fell to the ground as my left leg and arm were numb and in pain, then feeling slowly came back. After this mild neck pain and stiffness started and which over the last year has progressed to severe and seems to be traveling down into the top of my back. I have constant headaches and eyeball pain as well as muscular pain in arms and legs and general fatigue . Recently my numbness sensations have started to happen more frequently again awakening suddenly during the night with one side numb and in pain and causing me to fall, sometimes i just awaken with just my arms numb. I had MRI of BRAIN AND CERVICAL SPINE in March 2012 both were clear. At time of scans i had very MILD neck pain/stiffness and only 1 episode of numbness. Since then they are becoming more and more frequent and my doctor has now diagnosed me with anxiety. Can you still have ms with an all clear mri scan? I do believe i have some anxiety but can this not also be a symptom of MS? Everything i have read, forum after forum its quite clear that doctors miss-diagnose ms all the time and that it is a very hard disease to diagnose. I am also getting physical therapy for the neck with no real affect, and when my pyhsio performed a reflex reactions exam there was no reaction to my left arm, when i told the doctor he completely ignored it. I am 25 year old male non smoker who has went from attending the gym twice a week, playing for an amateur football team and golfing regularly to basically sitting in front of the TV and not wanting to do anything.\\nAnswer: Hi, welcome to HCM. Fortunately you are not suffering from multiple sclerosis.  It affects functions very severely.  There nothing like a numbness in only one arm or leg. So please forget about MS. Also for diagnosis there should be combined features of clinical and radiological features. I think your doctor is correct.  You are having anxiety related disorder. Just take a second opinion of cervical spine imaging.  Otherwise you need to consult for anxiety. Hope I have answered your query. Regards.',\n",

Amount of pain which occurs after tooth extraction is dependent on procedure which is used for the extraction of the tooth and the degree of trauma to the adjacent tissues.Pain can be managed after tooth extraction withover the counter pain medicaments.Analgesics are given after the tooth extraction to relieve the pain.During the first 24 hours after tooth extraction, you should take soft and liquid diet and should avoid taking food from the side where tooth was extracted. It is advised to do warm saline rinses 24 hours after the tooth extraction to reduce the pain and swelling. Take rest.You should avoid spitting, sucking, drinking anything with straw for minimum of 24 hours after tooth extraction and should not smoke for minimum of 2 days after tooth extraction.Smoking can create negative pressure and can cause dislodgement of clot and lead to dry socket. It is also common to have pain in the jaw after the extraction as the mouth is held open for long time during the tooth extraction. Massaging the muscles gently, hot compresses application and over the counter analgesics can reduce the soreness of the jaw. Allow relaxation of the muscles and the jaw joint and don’t take hard crusted foods.',\n",

You are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease).  It is due  to  laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms  of burning  chest pain. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1.  Avoid  stress and tension. 2. Avoid  large  meals, Instead take frequent  small meals. 3. Avoid hot and spicy food. 4. Start proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after  meals. 6.

I can understand your concern. Yes animal fur, dander etc are very allergic to susceptible individuals. So possibility of allergy due to Guinea pig is more in your son's case. Best treatment of allergy is identification of allergen and complete avoidance of it. So better to take out Guinea pig from your home. He needs anti histamine and anti allergic drugs.

It is very tricky how myoma reacts with the pregnancy. The thing is that the chances of it increasing in size during pregnancy are high, and sometimes it may cause pain.

I have been on p.o. iron for 5 months (serum feritin was 3 in nov 2010 and mar 2011 was 7). Also, celiac sprue panel negative. Hgb 13.8. All other blood tests and serum chemistry are normal. U/A was negative for blood. Retic count 2.5%. I have also had a couple of night sweats, spleen was 12 cm in 11/2010 and 14.5 cm in 2/2011, also I have 2 cervical lymph nodes (about 1cm each) enlarged just above clavicle. They are painless, but non-fixed and have been enlarged for about 8 weeks but have not increased in size. I have had no recent illnesses, except for strep throat in 12/2010 and glomerulonephritis shortly after that. I also have very bad exertional dyspnea since about october, to the point where I'm SOB after 2-3 minutes of minimal exercise (and i've been taking tae kwon do for 2 yrs without any trouble unitl recently).

No family hx of iron absorption dz. My hematologist recommended IV iron dextran 1x per month x 4 months. Just wanted to know if I need a second opinion or is this just probably an iron absorption problem. Only past med hx is mild GERD. Currently taking nexium (for past 5 years ) and Bifera rx iron supplement (since nov. 2010).\\nAnswer: Hello, I would suggest an FNAC fine needle aspiration cytology of your neck lymph nodes if they are still enlarged. I presume that you have had a peripheral blood smear evaluated by a hematopathologist. If not then peripheral blood smear examination is necessary. If you have not done certain tests such as TSH thyroid stimulating  hormone test you may also get that done. Based on your description your condition appears to be iron deficiency anemia. The exertional breathless sensation may be a symptom of anemia. However as anemia is uncommon in a young male further work up is necessary especially that of your lymph node. A second opinion from a hematologist is prudent to exclude the possibility of a condition called lymphoma of your lymph node . Though it is a rare possibility it is prudent to get a second opinion.

The egg is released 14 days prior to the next menses. The egg lives for 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a week around the day of egg release is a fertile period. If you had unprotected sex during this fertile window, you have got high chances of becoming pregnant. The best indicator of probable pregnancy is missing a period. All other symptoms appear a week or more after that. So if you miss your period, get your urine tested for pregnancy which will guide you. I hope this helps you.',\n",

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Hereby, I am giving you my opinion regarding your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your CBC showing microcytic hypochromic anemia. Anemia means a low hemoglobin level oxygen-carrying carrying capacity of blood gets affected. Your reticulocyte is high and polychromasia present with high bilirubin. So you can have hemolytic anemia and iron deficiency anemia combined picture. I suggest following investigation for you: According to reports, a further management plan can be decided. You will need an iron tablet or injection to improve hemoglobin level but above reports have to be done to find the cause. In hemolytic anemia, RBC destruction occurs and the underlying cause is searched for that. Your report is not showing any cancer sign so do not worry.

For about the last month, I ve been having frequent unprotected sex. Halfway through the month however, I decided to skip over some of the white pills for my period and just moved on to a new pack. Now, I m sometimes having a brown discharge on my underwear and its light pink when I wipe. However, I ve been feeling nausea on and off for the last 2-3 weeks. What do you think is wrong?\\nAnswer: Hallow Dear,If you were consuming Yaz pills regularly, you need not be worried about the unprotected intercourses you had since these pills are reliable birth control pills. If after the menses you have shifted from one brand to another brand of the pills, it is permissible and will give you protection form pregnancy. You have not mentioned which brand you have shifted to; hence I cannot know what are contents and the dosages of the contents in these pills. Some brownish to pinkish discharge you are having on yours panties is break through bleeding. If such bleeding becomes bothersome, you may take two pills on that day to stop the bleeding. Otherwise you may ignore it. Nauseating feeling you are having is due to increased acidity due to the hormones in the pills. Some proton pump inhibitor antacid like Pantoprazole will help you to get relief from nausea. I do not think, you need worry about it. If the new brand of pills is not suiting you, you may switch back to Yaz again after this menses. However, if you have any doubt about pregnancy, you may get pregnancy test done on the overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period (if at all you miss). Earlier these tests may give false negative results. Alternatively you may opt for Beta hCG test which is very sensitive and gives you reliable results even few days before missing a period.

              "  \"Question: I had a lumbar puncture two days ago to check my pressure because I am having a loud whooshing pulsating noise in my ears and headaches. My pressure was high. It was 28. Dr tried to remove fluid to relieve pressure but couldn t because it hurt too badly. It hurt in the butt area towards bottom of tailbone like someone was poking or shocking it and pain down my right leg. For the past two days I have had extreme pain down lower back and right leg making it difficult to sit, stand or bend. Just the smallest movement of bending my head to kiss my baby sends the extreme pain to my lower back. I am also experiencing extremely fatigue. It is very hard to even hold my eyes open. Is this a normal reaction to the lumbar puncture and the attempt to remove fluid ?\\nAnswer: Brief Answer:Fatigue and pain is a normal reaction to lumbar puncture.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. I understand your concern.After the lumbar puncture, you may feel pain or tenderness in your lower back. The pain might radiate down the back of your legs. In most cases, the pain will ease after a few days and it can be treated with painkillers, such as paracetamol.Fatigue, does fit with performing of the procedure. You may develop a headache, nausea, fatigue afterward due to a leak of fluid into nearby tissues. A pain-relieving medication that contains acetaminophen can help you reduce headache too.Try to rest and don't participate in strenuous activities. Regarding the results of the cerebrospinal fluid taken by lumbar puncture, is important to evaluate his appearance, WBC count, Glucose level, Protein level, beside the opening pressure (that in your case is elevated), in way to be focused into a possible diagnosis. It can be considered additional tests such as CSF culture, depending on clinical findings.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards, Dr. Juarda\",\n",

My question is, Does the foreskin naturally retract by its self? Or do you have to pull it over your gland?\\nAnswer: Hello ! The Foreskin does not retract by itself. In some cases the foreskin maybe very tight and adherent to the penis whereby the it obstructs free flow of urine, this condition is called Phimosis. In this case circumcision is adviced as it may lead to infections. It is adviced generally that all uncircumcised males should retract the Foreskin and wash it gently with warm water but not soap as a white Cheesy material called smegma collects between the groove of the penis and foreskin. This smegma sometimes gives rise to unpleasant odour so its adviced to wash once in a while.',\n",

There are two likely causes for your mother's symptoms: 1. Arthritis of hip joints- it is common in older people. X-ray of the hips can help in diagnosing this condition. 2. Lumbar disc disease with compression of the nerves at back- this can lead to pain and weakness of legs. An additional condition to exclude is osteoporosis- weakness of bones- which is again common in old age.

Thank you for posting your question.I can understand your concern.First of all  DO NOT PANIC.First I will give you some information and then the steps to be done now.YES HCV can transmitted through needle prick(lancet in this case).After a needlestick or sharps exposure to HCV-positive blood, the risk of HCV infection is approximately 1.8% (range: 0%–10%). i.e only 18 in every 1000 needle pricks are at risk.So there are 982 people who do not get it. Now , what to do!HCV infection can be detected by anti-HCV screening tests (enzyme immunoassay)            4–10 weeks after infection.   1.baseline testing for anti-HCV and ALT(Alanine Transaminase) activity AND2.follow-up testing for anti-HCV (e.g., at 4–6 months) and ALT activity. If earlier diagnosis of HCV infection is desired, testing for HCV RNA may be performed at 4–6 weeks.3.Confirmation by supplemental anti-HCV testing of all anti-HCV results reported as positive by enzyme immunoassay.Blood groups do not matter.Do not worry. Take the tests .Hope this helps.Post any other question. We will be happy to help.Have a nice day. Regards',\n",

But in order to prevent further fall in heart function, he should have either of two. Bypass is a better option but has more risk. So you need to take the risk and go ahead with either procedure.

The blast range from small to intermediate in size by a forward light scatter and express moderate CD 117, dim CD113, dim to negative CD33, bright CD34, heterogeneous CD38, heterogeneous HLA-DR but negative for CD10, CD20, CD3, CD45, CD56, Cd64.

Sorry to hear about his ill health. Let me tell you that after seven days of the first round of chemotherapy, bone marrow biopsy should be done to check for the percentage of the blast. Ideally, it should be less than 5 % blast after the first round of chemotherapy. Then consolidation chemotherapy is given to prevent relapse of leukemia cells. Stem cell transplantation can be done in young age group people but it is costly. So various chemotherapy and stem cell transplant is the only therapy available.

Further tests may be needed to establish the cause (bacterial blood culture, urine analasis, etc.), especially if you have fever. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. Hope to have been helpful!Best wishes, Dr. Iliri\",\n",

I had gallbladder removed,complete hysterectomy,had appendix removed. Been like this for 2 years.Had all the test that can be done and still no answer to my problem, can you help me?\\nAnswer: Hi! From your history of repeated surgeries you underwent, there are a few possibilities which should be looked into. Without having the details of the investigations you have undergone till now, following is suggested: 1) With the surgeries you have undergone, immediate clinical diagnosis which comes into mind is multiple post operative adhesions of the intestines to the previous scars, due to which the intestines are not able to move smoothly and propel both liquids and solids resulting in sub acute to acute intestinal obstruction. In this case the person gets recurrent pain abdomen with inability to pass stool or flatus. Since you have got the problem since last 2 years, it seems more like a sub acute one than acute. For this you have to consult a general surgeon, who will examine you clinically preferably during an attack , and may advise you for a few investigations, like TLC, DLC, HB%, X- ray abdomen with diapragm in upright position, and an ultrasound. 2) Next, with history of cholecystectomy, one has to consider stones in the CBD, and any pathoogical process  n the pancreas. This will also need some special investigations like ultrasound abdomem, or may be a CTscan of the abdomen if advised by the doctor. Along with this, serum amylase, lipase, and a LFT might also help. 3) Sometimes irregular dietary habits may also be the culprit. Try to take fat free meals at regular intervals, with more of roughages, and liquids and a regular exercise programme depending on your age and body weight. 4) Ifall these investigations are already done, and nothing could be detected till now, then you may have to consult a laparoscopic gasto enterologincal surgeon, who may consider to do a endoscopic examination of your intestinal tract and also a diagnostic laparoscopy of  the abdomen if thought appropriate in your case. Wishing you an early recovery.',\n",

              "  'Question: Hello doctor, I suddenly feel a tingling sensation after urination and a slight prick sort of a thing. I visited a doctor for the same and had been diagnosed with a urine infection. I also have a constant urge to urinate. He gave a dose of antibiotics which I had to take for three days. But I just had it for a day and a half as I felt better and I feel the same again. Is it the urine infection itself which has continued? Also, my doctor told me that it is urine infection only and that I will have to take Norflox 400 mg for five days two times.\\nAnswer: Hello. Based on your symptoms, you seems to have a urinary tract infection. The treatment is a full course of antibiotics which ranges from three to seven days depending on the severity of symptoms. Antibiotics usually give symptomatic relief in 24 hours but it takes minimum three days to clear the infection completely. As you had stopped the medication in between, you most likely have a persistent UTI (urinary tract infection). You will have to finish your antibiotic course and in your case, it is better to take for five days because it is a residual infection. If you still have symptoms after completing your antibiotic course, it would be necessary to further investigate with a urine culture and ultrasound.

He said they are small-sized follicles, he abandoned the cycle, told me to go for ovarian drilling. I want a second opinion on that, please. Why do I not respond at all? I follow diet and exercise.\\nAnswer: Hello. Your hormone profile suggests PCOD. What is the size of ovaries on ultrasound? If not done, you should do blood tests, sugar PP, TSH, prolactin, and testosterone. Often, oral contraceptive pills like Diane 35 (Cyproterone and Ethinylestradiol) taken for three months help in increasing the size of follicles in the subsequent cycles.

              "  'Question: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?\\nAnswer: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

              "  \"Question: Hello doctor,My mother is now 55 years and has been suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) for over a year. Her condition was not so bad before. She was diagnosed with intestinal disease and was given some antibiotics like Flagyl or Metronidazole. After she took those pills for a month, she had frequent loose or watery stool (without blood) and could not eat spicy or fatty food, sugar or any foods containing lactose. I found a probiotic supplement called Bifina, which helped a lot in controlling her toilet routine and her diet but needed to use together with Smecta. She still cannot eat spicy or fatty food, but she can have a drink or juice with an acceptable amount of sugar, which serves as a rehydration drink. She no longer has loose or watery stool. Once in a while if she reacts with a kind of food or eat more sugar than necessary, her stool will be softer with a few bubbles. In general, her bowel movement is under control.She is starting to recover but her long-term IBS resulted in her exhaustion. As I previously mentioned, she is now still using the probiotic supplement, Bifina, which helps a lot with the intestine treatment makes her easily feel tired or a little dizzy. I asked for support from a relative who works as a nurse because the doctors in my neighborhood just told her to get a rest and give her pills that did not help a lot. So, the nurse frequently gives her some vitamin B12 shots, Glucose 5% intravenous infusion and lactated Ringer's solution 500 ml for injection. This proves to help, but she tells me that she do not have enough energy. We went back to phlebotomy department to have her blood tested. It turned out to be fine, but every time her scores were very low. We thought the hospital could give her any session like fluid infusion or blood transfusion because she had diarrhea for over 10 months. It just stopped about 2 months ago and really has worn her out. But, they just informed me to go to another department like division of general internal medicine. We have already been there and have checked everything like x-ray, heart, liver, and kidney. Attached below are some images of her test results. Could you tell me if we are right to say she needs blood transfusion to help her recover better? Or she needs another solution? Or just stick to what we are doing now? I express a huge thanks for being patient and reading for so long now. I appreciate every answer. Thanks again.\\nAnswer: Hi. I have gone through your query and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can understand your concern. As you told that your mother had IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), I want to tell you that antibiotics are not the treatment for IBS. Probiotics can help. She might have developed antibiotic induced diarrhea after taking tablet Flagyl (Metronidazole). I have seen her reports and they seem to be normal except ultrasound which is difficult to interpret as it is not clear.  No need to worry she might have developed malabsorption syndrome because of chronic diarrhea as she cannot tolerate lactose containing food. There is no need to give excess vitamin B12 unless there is deficiency. Your mother needs proper evaluation and blood transfusion is not required. Get her serum vitamin B12, folate, serum calcium, vitamin D, stool routine and occult blood checked. Consult a gastroenterologist. As she had chronic diarrhea she needs colonoscopy also.

Then afterwards I get a headache.  What could be wrong?Thanks\\nAnswer: Hello!Welcome on HCM!Your symptoms seem to be related to orthostatic hypotension. I recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure in sitting and then after 3 minutes of standing up position. If there is a decrease more than 20 mmHg of your systolic blood pressure and more than 10mm Hg in the diastolic blood pressure this would indicate orthostatic hypotension. In such case a Head Up tilt test would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Other lab tests would help exclude other possible causes that may trigger this situation: - complete blood count for anemia- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Aida\",\n",

I have been taken off 2 of my 3 meds to see if this is a side effect and now my blood pressure med has been changed. I lose my voice on and off all day. For months now my voice has not been normal. Had throat scope and sinus ct both ok. Had a lung ct and it showed alittle scaring and nodules. I m so scared I have cancer but I m just waiting around for my next dr appointment. I don t feel like I m getting anywhere with a diagnosis.\\nAnswer: Change in voice along with lung nodules are not a good sign and may indicate cancer although this is not for sure based on the scanty information that you have provided. You definitely need further investigations in order to reach a diagnosis. The best will be to get a needle test done from the lung nodules if they are big enough (FNAC). This will be done under CT guidance. If they are not big enough, then a bronchoscopy (endoscopy of the respiratory tract) with lavage and cytology might help.Also, send your sputum for culture and cytology.',\n",

If it is not near or in approximation to important anatomical structures like maxillary sinus or inferior alveolar nerve canal, then it can be left out like that.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicLichen planus (LP) has an autoimmune etiology.It presents as itchy, polygonal, violacoeus or purple coloured, flat lesions.Itching is a prominent feature in lichen planus.Sites commonly affected are wrists, abdomen (flanks), shins, flexor arms.The disease may be localized or generalized.Oral mucosa as well as nail involvement may also be seen in LP. Oral lesions may cause eating and swallowing difficult.The diagnosis of LP is mostly clinical however a skin biopsy may be ordered to confirm the clinical diagnosis.Skin biopsy in LP is performed under local anaesthesia. You would be awake but you wont feel the pain.Topical treatment of lichen planus is with prescription topical superpotent steroids e,g clobetasol propionate cream OR Halobetasol propionate cream. These alone are sufficient for limited disease.In addition to topical steroids, oral steroids and hydroxychloroquin are also used in treatment of Lichen planus, specially when it is widespread.Lichen Planus has a good prognosis, the lesions ultimately subside but there may be a few recurrences before it finally subsides.Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation may persist for months of years after LP has resolved.Regards',\n",

I think you know very well to avoid , dust , mite , pollen , hay , fodder, fine dusting powder , humidity , sudden fall & rise of temperature because all these are predisposing ( triggering ) factors of asthma. Asthlin is a potent bronchodilator and safe and effective but budocort is a cortcosteroid ( many doctor like it but I never prescribe or advise except in emergency because of side effects).When such type of patient visit in my clinic I prescribe them to take monteleukast+ bambuterole tablet ( combo pack ) once or twice in day till complete relief .Hot coffee and steam inhalation are very safe and effective bronchodilator , so also try.For first few days you will require asthalin+ budocort , but after few days you will feel relaxed and dosage of asthalin+ budecort will subside ( I have tried in so many cases ).Hope this information will help you.Good luck.',\n",

Would taking Fluconazole have hindered my ability to conceive yesterday? I am trying to conceive. I took Genevin in the past, which was a wrong prescription out of assumption).\\nAnswer: Hello. According to many researchers, Fluconazole 150 mg single dose is not too harmful to pregnancy but it is better to avoid it. The drug is antifungal if you have taken it and had sex no particular action on sex actually and on sperm and its way to cover path inside the femalebody. But if pregnancy happens, then you should not have fluconazole as medication so no more tablets till you confirm you are pregnant or not.  If no pregnancy then only you take this tablet. Otherwise better to have Canesten (Clotrimazole) pessary vaginally on alternate nights for two nights. The infection will come out vaginally. Fluconazole should not interfere in conception actually.

If so the common causes are spread of infection from the urinary tract or occasionally affection from mumps among other causes. My practice would be to do an ultrasound of the urinary tract as a minimum to make sure there are no abnormalities there.

Focused sonographic examination of this area reveals a hypoechoic structure taller than wide and measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Are these usually cancer?\\nAnswer: Hi,Thanks for writing in.Focused breast ultrasound helps to determine characteristics of doubtful lesions in the breast. As described above, there is a dark area as seen on ultrasound at the 9 O clock position. This is marginally taller than wider if we take measurements as 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm. In some research studies, it has been found that 74 to 80 percent breast lesions which were taller are malignant. This way breast biopsy is the best confirmation and you have already got it done. By appearance, I will say that please do not worry as the lesion is slightly taller than wider and we can still hope for a benign finding. The final result is by biopsy. Please do not worry.',\n",

A while ago it started to smell, and so recently, I belive last week, I squeezed it and a brown cheese-like texture shot out, and it smells...What could this be? Im 19, 154 lbs, and in great health and physical shape. No major medical problems either.\\nAnswer: Hi. This may be epidermal cyst or a sebaceous cyst which forms when the secretions of the glands become blocked in the skin. It is not harmful till due to some reason it becomes infected. Treatment is full excision of the cyst. Squeezing out may lead to partial treatment. It may grow slowly may become prominent again after few months. Next time if it becomes prominent, please show it to any surgeon as it is easier to take it out completely when it is prominent. No active treatment is required now until unless there is sign of infection like pain, redness, or local rise of temperature.\",\n",

What measures should I take and when should I repeat my test?\\nAnswer: Hello. I have gone through your report, and especially your triglycerides and HDL are deranged. These are not immediately life-threatening but may be harmful in long term. Firstly, I guess this was a fasting sample even without tea in the morning, if not then you should get it repeated with absolute fasting of at least eight hours as it can falsely elevate triglycerides. Next thing, you should have a period of 2 to 3 months with a healthy lifestyle before starting medicines as medicine may reduce triglycerides but it will again rise after you stop medicines. So maintenance is important with lifestyle changes. So, you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily and a high-calorie diet. Avoid free sugar, cola drink, and other beverages. Plenty of green leafy vegetables. Reduce alcohol consumption and smoking, non-vegetarian especially meat and chicken, if any. Most important are the exercise to burn your lipids, so should have at least 30 minutes a day and at least five days a week of exercise like brisk walking or running according to your capacity. After 2 to 3 months of a healthy lifestyle, repeat lipid profile and see for the changes. If there is no response then you may take medicines like Fenofibrate.',\n",

Please advise\\nAnswer: Hi, As the compression fracture of the spine may take anywhere up to 6-8 weeks of time. since no pain is there it will be good to use the brace for some more weeks to avoid any damage to the healed bone. Vitamin D3 for now will help the strength in the bones to be more strong and not brittle. Calcimax was the time where the calcium deposition was needed a lot to have the healing process to occur. Kindly be slow and don't rush up as spine is the major part of the human body.

I want to conceive.... current symptoms of pregnancy I am feeling are lower back pain.. lower abdomen pain.. little sickness... What should I do now??? Also, If we still have sex... would it be beneficial for pregancy?? or should we avoid until my pregancy test comes positive or get periods??\\nAnswer: Hallow Dear, If otherwise you had regular menses in the past and the pregnancy test is negative even 15 days after missed period, you are most probably not pregnant. This delay in the menses could be due to the apprehension for desired pregnancy. If you still want further confirmation, you have two options: ultrasonography and/or Beta hCG test. All the symptoms you are getting are likely to be due to apprehension of pregnancy. At this stage, sex would not be useful for conception. I would advise you to wait patiently for periods to appear. Another alternative is to take Tab. Deviry for 5 days and you will get withdrawal bleeding within 4-7 days. From day 9 onwards, you may go for ovulation monitoring by Ovulation monitoring kit or Ultrasonography. Try to adjust your marital relations on and around the day of ovulation. This will help you to become pregnant. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri',\n",

Care is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids that are lost from vomiting & diarrhoea. There's no role of oral anti-HBV drugs at this stage.However, you have to repeat the serological tests along with liver function tests after 6 months.The absence of IgM anti-HBc or the persistence of HBsAg for 6 months along with the presence of HBeAg, reactive HBV DNA & Total Anti-HBc indicates chronic HBV infection.In such a case you may be evaluated by specialist experienced in the management of chronic hepatitis B infection.Currently, Pegylated Interferon alfa (PEG-IFN-a), Entecavir (ETV), & tenofovir are the first-line agents in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B disease.Hope the advice given above would be useful to you.A feed back is highly appreciated.\",\n",

Does this mean she is still fighting the virus? Could she still be contagious to others? Should I be concerned for her?Ps. My husband & I both were sick too, but we don't have yellow stool?!\\nAnswer: HI, thanks for using healthcare magicGastroenteritis causes symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Some or all of these symptoms are present.If she is still having loose stools then the infection can still be transmitted.The risk of transmission is significantly reduced by careful handwashing since the infection can be passed in this way.At her age, you have to be very careful with her fluid management because children are at risk of dehydration. Her fluid losses need be replayed, oral rehydration fluid is the best option.Dehydration is associated with decreased urination, drowsiness, increased heart rate, dry skin/mouth, lack of tears.If any of these are seen then it would be best visit a doctor.I hope this helps\",\n",

              "  'Question: Is there a connection to seizures and artrial fibrillation? My husband has had 2 seizures within the past 4 years with no diagnosis after multiples tests for the cause. He recently had his first episode of atrial fibrillation , which landed him in the ER and an overnight stay in the hospital when the medications they gave him were not helping. The medications eventually helped after several hours and he was basically given a discharge with no restrictions written on the discharge papers. I am wondering if there is a connection to the seizures of unknown cause and this recent atrial fibrillation.\\nAnswer: Hi,Thank you for posting your query.There is usually no connection between seizures and atrial fibrillation.It is not unusual to find no cause for seizures.

              "  'Question: My husband thinks he may have been bit by a spider. His knee has a red area that burns to the touch and causes his pain. It kinda has a rough feel to it. The area around the knee looks swollen, but not real bad yet. I was wondering if Spider bites cause a burning sensation and pain like that. He doesn t feel sick or have a fever.\\nAnswer: Hello,Welcome to HCM,Only a few spiders are dangerous to humans. Two of them are black widow spider and the brown recluse spider. Both prefer warm climates and dark, dry places where flies are plentiful. They often live in dry, littered, undisturbed areas, such as closets, woodpiles and under sinks. Most presumed spider bites are actually bites from other bugs.Clean the site of the spider bite well with soap and water. Apply a cool compress over the spider bite location. If the bite is on an extremity, elevate it.Aspirin or acetaminophen and antihistamines may be used to relieve minor signs and symptoms in adults. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.Thank you.',\n",

              "  'Question: Hello doctor, My baby is a preterm boy. His actual age is 7.5 months and corrected age is 4.5 months. Birth weight was 960 gm and his current weight is 5.60 kg, drinking man-pro around 100 ml, 5 to 6 times a day. Since last 10 days, he has also been started on semisolid food. He had breathing difficulty because of a cough. We had got him early morning in the emergency for complaints of a heavy cough. He was nebulized but there was a wheezing sound due to which they said he would need PICU for monitoring. Currently, he is admitted in PICU. His saturation levels were fine but the doctor started him on oxygen with mask support. He was drinking milk well but they stopped his feeds as well and started IV liquid which does not suffice his hunger. They did all reports- blood and chest X-ray and everything was normal. His heart rate was on the higher rate of 150 to 180. The first thing they did was that they stopped the feed, he cried and cried for more than half a day wanting food in which he lost a big amount of energy. Until the morning, I got him to PICU. He was playful but second half of the PICU admission day he was looking very tired. The wheezing had increased. At night they took a call to put him on HFNC due to increased wheezing. He was restless the whole night and till early morning his heart rate was 185 to 201. Now, it has come down to 150 to 165 but he is still on HFNC and feeds have not started yet. My concerns are as follows. He was given oxygen support at the initial stage as required when he was able to breathe and maintain the saturation levels without it. Was it necessary to stop his feeds as that has taken away all his energy and he is distressed with hunger?\\nAnswer: Hi. I understand your concern. Your concern is whether oxygen was necessary. Whenever the baby is having wheezing and respiratory distress, giving Oxygen is necessary to avoid impending ventilation-perfusion mismatch. It is considered as supportive therapy even though the monitor might be showing 100 % saturation.  Was it necessary to stop the feed? Only treating doctor can decide. Whenever there is respiratory distress, children have a high risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia which is bad. But, whenever the baby is vitally stable, the baby can be started on the feed througha tube (RT feed). Treating doctor is best to decide about it. Still, if you have concerns. You are free to ask treating doctor. It is your right.',\n",

The ECG shows that you have a fast heart rate of around 120 bpm (100 is the upper limit normal at rest). This could be because you had the ECG immediately after walking long distance or not had adequate rest before you had the ECG. If this is done at rest (that is at least 10 minutes rest) then you need to start taking some medications to control the heart rate or increase the dose if you are already on one of those medicines.

Q-2) how can the patient be sure that the TB does not exist anymoreAns-2-IGRA blood test with gain of body weight and reduction in the lymphnode size,and lac of fever with increased appetite,are the signs of recovery.But practically-its not possible to be sure that the TB does not exist anymore.As one cant' reach out the organisms burried in the fibrosed healed scars in lymphnodes.Being omnipresent,recurrence of TB cant be prevented in times of stress,when either the old dormant bacteria in patients body/ or from the outside aggravate the relapsing infection in TB.Except IGRA blood test-which indicates the active TB infection,there is no certain test to declare that the TB does not exist anymore.This declaration is subject to these practical limitations.Hence practically,those patient in whom the patient comes out of the symptoms of the disease and maintains the criteria of clinical recovery with weight gain and recovery of complaints,it is not certain to define and declare the total cure of EXtra-pulmonary lymphadenitis,by now with current techniques.Q- 3) Does the tB medication affect future pregnancyAns-3-Its not the TB medication which affects the future pregnancy.ON the contrary, chances of having future pregnancy,after TB medication have increased comparatively.But in certain percentage, the failure is from the permanent changes which are out of correction tools either by medicines or by surgical correction of the anatomical barriers-like adhesiolysis.Q- 4) If someone who has completed TB medication happens to have a miscarriage could it be related/associated due to TB medicationAns-In the given scenario-Miscarriage is not related to TB medication as such,as the drug effects don't persist that long,and once the chance is taken for pregnancy,the drug effects are ruled out along with the general fitness of the body condition to sustain that pregnancy.Its the scarring and missed out unhealthy endometrium ,which could be the cause of the miscarriage in such cases-where the chance is taken for pregnancy.Hope this would help you to plan further care of this complex illness of yours.

              "  \"Question: Hello,I am suffering from Pulmonary TB from Jan'14. The doc has prescribed Forcox 2 tabs OD empty stomach x 2months. Post two months It has to be stopped and replaced with Macox Plus OD x 4months. The medicines were prescribed to me in a different city when I was travelling but now I am back to my city and cannot check with the Doctor who prescribed the medicines therefore I request you to guide me with the dosage of Macox Plus which will start in two weeks time. Since the doctor has not mentioned number of tablets how many should I take in a day. My age is 37, sex - male.Thanks,Gaurav Sharma\\nAnswer: Hi & Welcome.Tablet Forecox contains Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutal & Pyrizinamide whereas Tablet Macox contains Isoniazid & Rifampicin.These are the first line drugs used in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.As per the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program, DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment - Short course) is recommended for the treatment of tuberculosis wherein the drugs are taken only thrice a week instead of daily. This is cost effective, results in reduced side effects and improves patient's compliance (capacity to take the tablet regularly). As per the DOTS you should take the medicines as follows. 1. Two tablets of Forecox to be taken once daily, thrice a week for 2 months & followed by 2. One tablet of Macox to be taken once daily, thrice a week for 4 months. All the medications should be taken early morning before meals as this helps in proper absorption of the drugs.  Pyridoxine 10mg to prevent neuropathy (caused by Isoniazid) is added to this regime.You have been prescribed the correct treatment for TB. Since you have completed 2 months of treatment with tablet Forecox with Pyridoxine, now you need to take one tablet containing Isoniazid & Riframpicin (Macox) along with Pyridoxine for remaining 4 months.Hope this will help you in getting the proper treatment.\",\n",

              "  \"Question: My friend had an abortion done last year some time. She didn t have it done @ a clinic or hospital. She bought the abortions pills by someone, did it @ home and never went to hospital or clinic or seen any doctor after that. She never had a womb scrub or whatever. About a month ago she found out she s pregnant. The day after that she started bleeding but didn t think anythong of it as they say that it is normal to bleed in your first trimester. However, when she eventually decided to go see a doctor they did a pregnancy test and it showed negative. Is this a result of a miscarraige or what?\\nAnswer: Hallow Dear,I feel you should get certain medical knowledge which will clarify many of your doubts and also get some important messages.Firstly, she should not have instituted termination of pregnancy by abortion pills without Gynaecologist's advice. These medicines are prescription medicines and should be taken with appropriate prescription and advice; lest the risk of many complications. Now regarding her ?fresh pregnancy:Yes, after the medical termination of pregnancy, fresh pregnancy is possible after the next cycle. If her pregnancy test was positive, she could be pregnant again. However the dilemma is due to next day negative pregnancy test. Dear friend, even if she has aborted on the day she got her pregnancy test report positive, the very next day pregnancy test would not become negative due to abortion. It takes about a week to 10 days for the pregnancy test to report negative after the baby has become non-viable. So the possibility is that one of the tests is reporting incorrect. The fact that she has done first test after bleeding started suggests that this could be false positive result; however false positive results are not commonly known. To find out the true fact, please opt for Beta hCG test. This test is highly sensitive and gives reliable reports even few days before missing a period. I hope this will resolve your dilemma. To avoid such stressful confusing situations in the life, I would suggest you to advice your friend to use some reliable contraceptive method like condom, intrauterine device like copper T or birth control pills if she does not plan pregnancy in near future.I hope this helps you.\",\n",

What does it mean?\\nAnswer: Hello. Did he have any chest pain or heart attack in the past, or is he diabetic? To summarize the report, it says there is a decreased functioning of the heart, which most commonly occurs due to coronary artery disease or sometimes due to the weakening of the heart muscle. So, he should get his evaluation done, ECG (electrocardiogram), lipid profile, sugars both fasting and post lunch, and angiography. He should be on medicine to prevent further decline in the heart functions which includes Aspirin, Clopidogrel, statins like Atorvastatin, beta blockers like Metoprolol, ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitor like Ramipril, and diuretics like Spironolactone, etc. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

Yesterday I got severe palpitations and my health was very bad the whole night.  I am taking these medicines from last 3 years kindly suggest and advise me what to do.\\nAnswer: Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, i would explain that your symptoms seem to be related to anxiety associated with the reduce of Zapiz.You should know that Zapiz is a benzodiazepine, which can help control anxiety and the reducing of the doses could be associated to exacerbation of the symptoms. But a cardiac arrhythmia can not be excluded too. So I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x ray study and some blood lab tests : - complete blood count- thyroid function tests ( some changes in thyronorm may be needed)- blood electrolytes. If the above tests result normal, the most probable cause would remain a panic attack. In such case, you should discuss with your attending physician on the possibility of making some changes to your actual therapy, to help you control better your anxiety.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

Now I have all symptoms but also have numbness in my hands\\nAnswer: HIGreetings from Dr.Divakara.PThanks for posting your query.     Your symptoms are suggestive of Sinus Infection. Most of the time Sinus infections will subside in few days .      But numbness in hands has to be evaluated as it is not seen in Sinus Infection. It could be either a problem in Nerves or due to Calcium deficiency. For that I would advise you to get a Serum Calcium Ionised test done and revert back to me .    As of your Sinus Infection is concerned I recommend you to do Steam Inhalation 3-4 times a day , drink hot water , Avoid cold drinks , cold foof and avoid Citrus fruits.    You can also take Tyelenol for headache. Hope this information was useful to you. Any clarifications feel free to ask .',\n",

Good afternoon dr my 30 years old daughter was diagnosed borderline in spain by dr sastre rubio y brought her to venezuela where we live i cant find a terapist to treat her right now is taking pills for depresion, i am trying to find the best place where doctors know whow to treat this illness willl you please help me, thanks a lot\\nAnswer: Dear Mother,Need not worry, Like any disease, mental health issues are also treatable albeit, it may take some time.Have patience.The mental illnesses are largely due to faulty interactions of the individual and the environmental factors such as society whose members are parents, relatives , friends and the responses of the individual to any situations.As a result of these interactions there might be certain unresolved emotional issues which affect the secretion of the  chemicals in the brain and vice versa. A hereditary element which gets triggered with the social interactions can also be a cause of the mental health problem.Just like the digestive enzymes in the stomach, we have some chemicals in the brain as well. These chemicals enable a person to deal with situations in hand. For example, you felt happy when your daughter scored a good result in her academics and now you are sad when you see her suffering. Both these happiness and sadness and other related emotions like anger and disgust etc are regulated by the chemicals in the brain.The medications prescribed by the Psychiatrist will work wonders when collaborated with the services of a Qualified Psychologist who can facilitate the resolution of the emotional issues as stated earlier through patient listening, interpreting and rendering therapeutic techniques for a behaviour and lifestyle modification.An unconditional support in all respects from persons significant in her life is the need of the hour now.Happy days ahead for you and family !Dr Rajesh Thottingal KalamRehabilitation Psychologist from india',\n",

So, I have three different results from 3 different labs for the same person and i am afraid to try each result with my patient as the treatment coarse is usually long durated Clinical examination, U/S and doppler for both testes are irrelevant Thank you for cooperation\\nAnswer: Hi, I have understood your dilemma.In fact pus cells found in the semen are many times misleading. Routine laboratories label them as pus cells on their size. We have found that many times the labelled \\'pus cells\\' really turned out to be immature sperms. It seems that this could be the problem in your case. Please get the semen examined from a specialist androgen laboratory which will work up on the all the abnormalities - structural and functional also in your case and would report to you the correct facts. In case this turns out to be premature or immature sperms, you might have to get the male hormonal profile done - LF, Testosterone & ICSH to decide on further plan of management. An andrologist can guide you further.I hope this would clarify your dilemma to quite an extent.',\n",

At supper, hours later his upper lip swollen some and he said it felt numb. He also had orange juice for supper. He is breathing fine. No other symptoms. Could this be an allergic reaction to asprin or orange juice?\\nAnswer: Hi The aspirin, egg and fruit juice are all potential allergens in people with allergy and asthma. For a child of 7 you must avoid aspirin. paracetamol is a better choice. It can also cause gastric irritation. It is very likely that your son may have variant type of asthma who manifest allergy to aspirin and fruits. Fruits can cause rash with itchiness around the mouth and around the eyes. Aspirin and polyps of the nose with asthma occurs in a group of asthmatics. They should avoid other drugs like brufen and diclofenac which are called NSAID. or non-steroidal anti inflammatory. Subsequent exposures to these allergens can make the symptoms worse, so take care. Skin allergy test is not very specific, but there are doctors who strongly believe in it. I suggest that you avoid these for the time being and as he grows older you can check him out for asthma with a pulmonologist. You need to educate your son about his allergy and communicate with his school's nurse and friends not to offer him fruit juice. it is good to keep an epipen at home and also at school which is a life saving drug in case of emergencies. You need to learn how to use it when needed. Hope this helps.\",\n",

Anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, or other treatments tailored for patients may be necessary.Preparation and recognition of warning signs can help prevent or reduce the severity of heel pain.Supportive shoes are a must, but it’s not always obvious when to switch shoes or adapt them for the best fit. Consider these guidelines:• Use inserts to raise the heel, especially in flat-footed cleats• Discard shoes that caused pain.  Don’t use them for another sport• Wear well-constructed shoes designed for specific sports• Switch cleats often because they are not supportive shoes.Don’t skip warm-up or cool-down exercises.HOPE THAT HELPS.',\n",

And some nutrition has to be corrected by giving the child soups and juices containing iron.If I were your family doctor, I had insisted to give child most safe and harmless four herb combo esp designed in classic Ayurveda for small children to address seasonal and/or infectious respiratory tract congestions, fevers, lose motions, vomiting etc besides correcting metabolism, detoxification of intestines, carminative, creating immunity and cleaning lungs, bronchus etc. It is commonly available in India or ordered online. While you finish the course of current antibiotics regime, may start later too to convalesce fast or start giving parallel with some time gap.

How should I treat her mouth???\\nAnswer: Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concern...As per your complain all the symptoms that you have indicated of having a pink eye along with fever, cold, sores in mouth and swollen gums are all due to Viral infection leading to Viral Conjunctivitis and Viral Gingivostomatitis..Due to infection, the immunity of the body goes low and also in such an early age the immune system is not completely developed, therefore, it is leading to fungal infection on the tongue causing Oral Thrush and it is the cause for white coating over tongue..You should consult a Paediatrician and get him evaluated..In case if the Viral Infection is diagnosed you should give him Tylenol or Motrin for pain relief..Do cool compresses over gums for relief from Inflammation and reduction in swelling..In case of pain in the sores on tongue a numbing gel like Oragel can be applied..In severe cases antiviral Oral and topical Medication like Acyclovir therapy is given to the patient to reduce the duration of illness...Give him cool and bland diet..Give him sufficient rest..Maintain a good Oral hygiene and brush his teeth twice a day using an ultra soft toothbrush..For thrush Candid mouth paint will help in resolving the infection..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora..',\n",

Highest it has gotten is 101.8(under arm) he hasn t slept well and has barely eaten but he has taken fluids. He is very fussy ad was just in antibiotics for an ear infection. He recently had his 12mo vaccinations. I just dont if he is having a reaction to vaccinations or if there is something more going on here. Im calling our Peditrician tomorrow... Just wondering if I can find any answers sooner!\\nAnswer: Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

If it is through my blood and it shows no sign of cancer, why go through chemo and if it shows clean after treatment how do I know it was effective or more importantly warranted. Thanks Chris\\nAnswer: Recommendations for chemotherapy after all macroscopic (overt tumor that is visible to eye by imaging or clinical exam) tumor has been removed, is based on the natural history of the tumor which has been studied in clinical trials. If these tumors are not given chemotherapy in post surgery setting the microscopic cells which may be present at the site of tumor bed or in circulation will form a tumor nidus resulting in relapse or metastasis.So you may never know how useful the chemotherapy is until it is not given.',\n",

Any suspicious lesion should be operated and based on pathlogy report further treatment planned. As your doctor has not told you about cancer, you are not suffering from that disease.

              "  'Question: I have completed 17 weeks of pregnency. During my internal examination I was told by my doctor that my cervix is small. Its length is 3.3 cm. The doctor has suggested stitching the cervix For now, I am told to take bed rest and come again after 15 days for examination after which she will decide whether to give the stitch or not. Please tell me if having a small cervix can cause some problem and is stiching/ operation is compulsory. Also what are the risk associated with this condition.\\nAnswer: Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Cervical shortening (it is the length of the cervix that is measured) can be a risk factor for preterm labor as well as preterm delivery.  It should be measured accurately with a transvaginal ultrasound not just with a digital examination.However, the cervical length at which intervention is recommended and where we have real concern is a length of less than 2.5 cm.Cerclage (or placement of a stitch to close the cervix) really should only be performed if the length shortens to less than 2.5 cm.  The procedure itself has some risks including breaking the water at the time of the cerclage and infection of the cervix.However, the most effective treatment currently available to prevent preterm delivery with a short cervix is vaginal progesterone.  This is given as a cream or suppository and does not have the risks associated with cerclage placement.So in summary, I would not recommend any treatment if your cervix is longer than 2.5 cm, as a length of 3.3 is not considered a significant risk factor for preterm birth.  If your cervix shortens to 2.5 cm or less, vaginal progesterone is a safer and more effective means of preventing preterm delivery over cerclage.Furthermore, bedrest has not been shown to prevent preterm delivery in any scientific study, especially in your case as you are still in the second trimester and are not dilated.I hope I was able to effectively answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, Dr. Brown',\n",

So far as your question is concerned a bit more information about her history may be needed to reach to a conclusion. However, here in these lines, I shall try to explain some very basic concepts. Normally liver has smooth echotexture (in simple words you can use the word \"structure\" for echotexture) and heterogeneous echotexture means something wrong is going on that is disturbing the liver structure.Secondarily the kid is having enlarged spleen and portal lymph node.

              "  'Question: Hello,I am scheduled to have four impacted wisdom teeth removed this Friday, February 17, 2017.  It is a non-emergency, elective procedure at this time.  I am an otherwise healthy 30 year old male.  I had a medical checkup and bloodwork with my general practitioner about 6 months ago, and everything appeared to be normal.  During my consultation with my oral surgeon, my blood pressure was taken throughout most of the consultation, and no one mentioned to me that anything was out of the ordinary.  I regularly exercise 3 days a week with no significant shortness of breath or dizziness.  For my procedure on Friday, I am scheduled to undergo \"twilight\" anesthesia as explained by my oral surgeon.  I am unsure what exact drugs they will be using, but my understanding is that they will be similar to (if not the same) drugs used for general anesthesia.My question and high concern involves my recent recreational drug use and its potential adverse effects with the anesthesia.  I typically use alcohol and marijuana on the weekends (including this past weekend) with friends, which have caused no problems in the past.  More recently (as recent as last weekend), I have also engaged in moderate cocaine use.  I will be taking any and all steps necessary to abstain from cocaine usage going forward.  I would not consider myself \"addicted\" to it at this point, so abstinence should not be an issue.My understanding is that cocaine, due to its relatively short half-life, will typically leave your system within 72 hours.  I will be abstaining from all previously mentioned usage this entire week, and it will have been approximately 5 days between any usage and the procedure.Due to the nature of my work and my father\\'s relationship with the oral surgeon (he is a dentist, they refer work to each other, and I have given my father permission to view my medical records if necessary), I would strongly prefer to not mention any of this to the oral surgeon.  At the same time, I understand my safety is important.To boil all of this information down to my question, if the cocaine metabolites have left my system by Friday morning, will I be in a safer condition to undergo the procedure?  Because the procedure is elective, I have no problem postponing the procedure for another 1-2 weeks at a minimum to ensure my system is clean and my vitals are stable.  I have read conflicting medical research online, with some journals indicating a cocaine positive patient is not at any greater risk for complications than a cocaine negative patient, but I have seen other medical professionals recommending that such patients wait closer to 2 weeks.I apologize for the rather lengthy question, but I wanted to provide as much information as possible to receive a more informed response.  I do appreciate your help and advice.\\nAnswer: Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Yes, it is true that you should be clean of any recreational drugs in your blood before you go for any anaesthesia procedure. You should be free from any drug intake for about 2 weeks.But still without intimating your Doctor/dentist, it is not appropriate to proceed for treatment procedure. So, my suggestion is to discuss with your dentist and get a blood test done and once you are assured then you can proceed for anaesthesia and treatment.  Hope I have answered your query.

Why didn't the cat scan show erosive gastritis and what is associated with this diagnoses.  I was also admitted into the hospital to rule out a heart attack. Had stress test, echocardiagram and carotid artery test. All tests were normal.\\nAnswer: Hi ! It is good that all tests related to your heart were normal. Erosive gastritis m gives rise to esophageal spasm which may mimic a cardiac problem.CT scan is not the ideal investigation to show erosive gastritis. It can be diagnosed with the help of your history, followed by the endoscopy. You can go for a proton pump inhibitor, a prokinetic agent, and an antacid after consulting your doctor, and at the same time you should go more for bland diet, fresh vegetable and fruits, and avoid fast fried food from outside. Biopsy is a routine procedure whenever an endoscopy is done to exclude many other pathological processes associated with chronic esophasitis.

Yes, you need treatment for this but before that, you need to be evaluated by a doctor to find the cause of it. As medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, thyroid dysfunction and psychological conditions such as depression and anxiety can cause such symptoms.

Am I just freaked out and over exaggerating?\\nAnswer: **1. swallowed/ingested foreign body [FB] requires examination, initially by your physician  who might order an x-ray to identify the presence or absence of any FB [chicken bone] or signs of perforation [sharp pain] and later by a specialist who may do a flexible pharyngoscopy under local anaesthesia to identify the position of the FB.2. If your doctor or specialist thinks that the FB is small, you may be given  antibiotics and asked to return frequently to be checked thoroughly. 3. since your present condition is stable, conservative management with follow-up at 24 hours will suffice.PS.  You should see a doctor if there is suspicion of a FB lodged. Do not wait for complications to arise or go for self remedies.',\n",

But chances of this os very less.During surgery, due to handling of tumour mass, there is great risk of spillage and peritoneal seeding by tumour cells. This is unavoidable. So this can give rise to recurrence.  So in modern era this is the reason for which post operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is given. The basic principle is to kill seeded malignant cells.So peritoneal seeding during surgical handling can be the cause for your recurrence.',\n",

However, I did look at pictures from years ago and noticed different degrees of anisocoria. Now that someone has pointed it out, I obsess over it and see it a lot. It only happens periodically (at various times during the day), no other symptoms. What could cause anisocoria that is occasional and been going on at least three years as indicated by pictures? I am on medications for gastroparesis and generalized anxiety like Zofran, Phenergan, Pantoprazole, and Paxil. I read Paxil could potentially cause anisocoria.\\nAnswer: Hello. There are different pathological causes of anisocoria, as you mentioned that you are taking medications, including Paxil (Paroxetine). It means drug levels are changed in blood and its effect on pupil size. If you are not having any problem, there is nothing to worry about as you know that its due to drugs or medications you are taking. If you notice any other changes like blurred vision, severe headache, or any neurological defect, then you should consult your doctor. You are alright and do not worry about scarce things.

If the xray is negative for a fracture, then the other possibility is soft tissue injury either to the ligaments, tendons etc.The initial management for your condition is as follows -- Give adequate rest to the injured part and avoid any movements that produces pain- Apply ice wrapped in a damp towel to the injured area for 15 to 20 minutes every two to three hours during the day- Compress or bandage the injured area to limit any swelling and movement that could damage it further. You can use a crepe bandage or a simple elastic bandage - Keep the injured area raised and supported on a pillow to help reduce swelling. - Gentle massage with a pain killer cream over the injured area might be helpful If your symptoms are still persisting after the above measures, consult an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and management.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care',\n",

              "  'Question: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?\\nAnswer: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Good morning!Welcome to HCM!!!  how are you/Brief answer: You are suffering from Herpes labialis with influenzaDetailed answer: The painful blisters on both the lips and the roof of your mouth is due to a virus infection known as Herpes labialis. These blisters erupt whenever there is accompanying fever due to influenza or change of weather, stress, etc. Your present problem can be effectively treated by the following:Tab Acyclovir, 400 mg, taken orally (by mouth) 5 times a day for 5 days, decreases the pain duration and healing time.You may also use the sunscreen to protect your lips during day time.For prevention of future attacks of herpes you are advised to use the same medication before the eruption of full blisters.I hope I tried to solve the problems.',\n",

The emergency department could give you pain medications, but they would not be able to remove the wart. You need to see a podiatrist and get the wart treated so that it is removed completely.

Try taking 800mg ibuprofen every 8 hours. Use ice packs on your heel frequently during the day. Get a bunion pad, foam pad with hole in the middle, and place it over the wart, so that when you walk you are not putting pressure directly on the wart. Good luck to you.',\n",

I have pain in areas such as shoulder, right groin, hand under the elbow and sometimes feel difficulties in chest. Only one lymph node got enlarged. My blood work is reported four times and is normal. I had an antibiotic course twice for two weeks. In these four months, though I was in stress I gained 12 pounds of weight.I need your opinion on the following. Do all lymph nodes seen around or in left supraclavicular areas are more prone to cancer such as lymphoma, NHL or gastric cancer? What is the probability for that? How much is the size of the lymph node to be cancerous or worry about? Do you think I have lymphoma or Non-Hodgkin lymphoma? I am having pale skin, black stool, blood in stool and stomach swelling, is this due to the stomach or gastric cancer? Why my node is not growing in size? Everybody says the node related with lymphoma and NHL is persistent and one. Is that right?\\nAnswer: Hi. Based on your queries, my opinion is as follows: Node is partially fibrotic, so it is not able to go back to its original size. There is no reason for it to grow, as there is no infection or cancer. Yes, nodes are persistent and usually multiple and increasing in size. But here it is not. At your age, very low chance for cancer. If doubtful, get an FNAC or biopsy of lymph node done. It will confirm. Blood work is useless, unless it is blood cancer. Do get back with the biopsy of the lymph node and stool examination report for further opinion. At present, no cancer based on clinical details. 1. Lymph node biopsy. 2. Ultrasound abdomen. 3. Stool examination.',\n",

I have tried to examine myself and the lumps do not look like warts and I don t experience any sort of burning or itching in this area\\nAnswer: Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some benign cyst or tumor in vaginal area.  Your discharge is mostly due to infection like bacterial vaginosis or some fungal infection.  You should go for gynecological examination once.  Then you should take treatment accordingly.  For lumps no treatment is required mostly.  If needed you can go for surgical removal. Antibiotics like metronidazole and clotrimazole can be used if you have infection. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using health care magic. Wish you a very good health.',\n",
              "  \"Question: hi there i am just recovering from a lower respitatory chest infection. I finished my antiobiotics last week. I went to my gp thursday morning and felt fine for a check up. She took all my bloods then and said my chest was clear. At lunchtime a dreadful tiredness came over me and i have been sleeping alot since then. Is this all part of my sickness?\\nAnswer: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Yes, some degree of weakness is common after respiratory tract infection. Your weakness was worsen by blood reports. Many patients have tendency to feel more weakness when they give blood for reports. It is more of psychological. So don't worry. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Take multivitamin tablets. You will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

This is where the initial injury caused a bruise with blood collecting into the tissues and causing the soreness. Although the soreness may have improved, the hematoma will take longer to disappear and will feel like a lump in the muscle.Regards,Dr K A Pottinger',\n",

              "  \"Question: I am a woman who just turned 57 and I ve been having black discharges that have started to occur a lot more. I don t know if it s from my bladder or vagina . Had my uterus taken out 17 years ago but they kept my ovaries. It s definitely a very black discharge and I have to wear a pad every day. Most times while going to the bathroom, after I urinate, there is a strong foul smell. I ve never have had a smell that bad. Sometimes my kidneys are tender and ache. The thing that concerns me the most is that it s an actual BLACK discharge with strong smell. It s not a brownish black or dark brown . My discharge is always black and never varies with any other color. What could this possibly mean? Thank you.\\nAnswer: Hi'  The black discharge is most likely to be coming from the vagina because unless you have incontinence it is not possible to have come from bladder. Get your urine tested for evidence of infection and sugar. Get your blood sugar checked. Also ultrasound of the abdomen to look for the kidneys. Visit you gynaecologist and if everything is normal take urology consultation. Sometimes old clot looks like black discharge.\",\n",

My first thought is it is probably puberty but I am thinking now I should make an appt. With his pediatrician\\nAnswer: Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your son may have gynaecomastia.  It is common at pubertal age.  You should go for examination.  If needed go for fine needle aspiration cytology of that lump.  It will give you exact diagnosis.

            "Answer: There are many factors that can contribute to high blood pressure. Some common causes include:\n",
            "\n",
            "  * Unhealthy eating habits: Consuming too much sodium, sugar, and saturated fat can increase blood pressure.\n",
            "  * Lack of physical activity: Regular exercise can help lower blood pressure by reducing stress and improving cardiovascular health.\n",
            "  * Smoking and alcohol consumption: These substances can damage blood vessels and raise blood pressure.\n",
            "  * Genetic factors: Some people may be more likely to develop high blood pressure due to their genetics.\n",
            "  * Hormonal changes: Changes in hormones such as pregnancy, menopause, and certain medications can affect blood pressure.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's important to note that high blood pressure is often referred to as \"the silent killer\" because it can go unnoticed until it becomes severe enough to cause complications such as heart attack or stroke. If you're concerned about your blood pressure, it's always best to speak with a healthcare provider who can evaluate your symptoms and determine the appropriate course of action.\n",
            "\n",
            "Query: Why is high blood pressure so common with people with diabetes?\n",
            "Answer: High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is relatively common among people with diabetes. There are several reasons why this occurs:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Insulin resistance: Diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, which means the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, leading to increased glucose production and storage in the liver and muscles. This can lead to high blood sugar levels, which can in turn increase the risk of high blood pressure.\n",
            "2. Obesity: Being overweight or obese increases the risk of high blood pressure because excess weight places extra strain on the heart and blood vessels, causing them to become narrowed and stiff.\n",
            "3. Poor diet: Eating a diet high in salt and low in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can contribute to high blood pressure. These foods can raise blood pressure by increasing sodium intake and reducing potassium intake.\n",
            "4. Lack of physical activity: Physical inactivity can contribute to high blood pressure by making the heart work harder to pump blood throughout the body. Regular exercise can help improve blood pressure control.\n",
            "5. Stress: Chronic stress can increase blood pressure by triggering the release of hormones such as cortisol, which can cause the walls of blood vessels to constrict.\n",
            "6. Genetic factors: Some people may inherit a genetic predisposition to high blood pressure, even if they have no other risk factors.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's important to note that high blood pressure is not a direct consequence of diabetes, but rather a complication that can occur as a result of the disease. To manage high blood pressure, it's crucial to control blood sugar levels, maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly, eat a balanced diet, and reduce stress. In addition, medication may be necessary to lower blood pressure.\n",
